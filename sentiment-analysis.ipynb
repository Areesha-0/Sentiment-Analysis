Yes, the production is okay, the cast too, but the humor just does not work very well and the horror is at most okayish. On paper a mix of Blob, Superstore and a buddy horror comedy a la Shaun of the Dead may look good but the execution meanders something on the edge of average and below average. What I miss mostly is some unique spark. Also there never is really some suspense like for example in the story of The Mist. Exact rate: 3 + 1 for Mr. Campbell's solid performance.</div>\n",

Nothing fitted!<br/><br/>The 'zombie-ness' starts more or less straight away...and absolutely nobody seems bothered, confused, or worried about what's going on.

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Black Friday! Reminded me a lot of recent horror/comedy Slaxx, in that it takes place in a store that is preparing for a sale and there are very few characters worth caring about; but where Slaxx was still passable fun thanks to its unique concept (a killer pair of denim jeans), Black Friday! Is a huge disappointment despite a reasonable cast (Bruce Campbell, Devon Sawa, Ivana Baquero and Michael Jai White are the best known names) largely thanks to a wholly predictable script in which the humour repeatedly falls flat.<br/><br/>The film takes place at a toy store on the eponymous date, when Americans flock to get their hands on vastly discounted goods. As the customers argue over stuffed toys and computer games, it soon becomes clear that something is wrong when the fighting turns to killing: the Black Friday shoppers have been infected by a malevolent extraterrestrial force that seeks to absorb humans to create massive kaiju-like monsters.<br/><br/>Like so many zombie films, the epidemic rapidly spreads, leaving a handful of survivors to team together - only in this case, they bicker and argue and generally act obnoxious. Sawa stars as WeLoveToys employee Ken Bates, a drunken wastrel with zero ambition - and he's supposed to be the hero of the film! Campbell is loathsome store manager Jonathan Wexler, who is willing to ignore the crisis to try and keep the cash registers ringing. Ryan Lee plays wimpy germaphobe Chris, and Stephen Peck plays a camp overweight employee with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. Baquero and White get to play likeable characters, but the former is essentially there as eye candy and the latter as alien fodder.<br/><br/>Directed with little style or originality by Casey Tebo, the whole thing is made even more intolerable by a loud, generic score that never seems to fit with what is happening on screen.<br/><br/>3/10 for the MUFX and gore by Robert Kurtzman, and that's being generous.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">When I saw the trailer for \"Black Friday\", I have to say that I was definitely looking forward to getting to see this movie. And now I just had the chance to watch it. And then how was it?<br/><br/>Well, it was watchable and enjoyable, for sure, but it was hardly a movie with the potential for becoming a holiday special. Nor was it a movie that had the cult makings of \"Evil Dead\", though there were some resemblances.<br/><br/>What initially drew me to watch \"Black Friday\" from writer Andy Greskoviak and director Casey Tebo was the fact that the movie had Bruce Campbell, Michael Jai White and Devon Sawa on the cast list. Plus it also seemed like a zombie movie of sorts. Well, sorts I suppose, as they were parasitic infected and not really reanimated dead.<br/><br/>The storyline in \"Black Friday\", as written by Andy Greskoviak, was a fun storyline. There were some nice moment throughout the course of the movie, I will say that. But as I stated earlier, this is not going to become a classic.<br/><br/>Now, I am not living in the USA, and while we in Denmark have implemented the Black Friday concept, I am sure that it is by no means up to the hectic and insane levels you see happen in USA. So on that account, I couldn't really get into the whole frantic shoppers feel of the movie.<br/><br/>Visually then \"Black Friday\" was good. The special effects were good and the make-up effects were good, and they definitely added flavor to the movie. So thumbs up to the special effects crew for their accomplishments here.<br/><br/>\"Black Friday\" does have a good cast list, and it was of course a blast to see Bruce Campbell in the role of Jonathan the store manager. Needless to say that Devon Sawa and Michael Jai White were also good. And I have to admit that it was fun to watch Michael Jai White in a movie such as \"Black Friday\".<br/><br/>Sure, I was entertained by \"Black Friday\", and I enjoyed the movie. However, I do doubt that this is a movie that I will return to watch for a second time.<br/><br/>My rating of \"Black Friday\" lands on a six out of ten stars.</div>\n",

This isn't clever at all. Dialogs, action, pace, characters... everything fails here in that department.<br/><br/>Totally wasted potential. Again, I can't imagine how this script got greenlighted, somebody of all the people reading it must have noticed how bad was the writing.<br/><br/>It's ok if you want a dumb watch, but I'm sure you can find easily something better.</div>\n",

They have to work as a team and leave their differences aside if they want to survive.<br/><br/>I have to admit that I did not have high expectations from this movie but I was expecting at least to laugh and have a great time. Unfortunately, that did not happen since it was a bit tiring after an hour. Despite its simple plot, it did not succeed on creating the feeling of terror and the way comedy and horror were combined was not the best. It also reminded the movies \"The Blob\" of 1958 and 1988, but those two were far better than \"Black Friday\". Lastly, I have to say that \"Black Friday\" is a below average comedy - horror movie and I do not recommend you to watch it, you can find far better movies than this one to spend your time.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Now this is a hot take opinion right here, most definitely. 7 stars for this movie? You lose some brain cells? Well when I started watching this movie, I definitely sided with the majority of people. But something magical, and full of wonder happened: 30 minutes into the film, something clicked - something happened in the scene and I began to look at the film in a completely different light.<br/><br/>And it was at this point that he knew - this was a good movie.<br/><br/>I know to a lot of people, this movie seems awfully serious with some comedy thrown in, but it's the opposite for me - all I see is a ragdoll stitched together with duct tape and patches of fabric with pop culture references. From the way the infected look like the Predator to the hilariously terrible CGI, I realized that this is just a meta movie about a boiler-plate infection that weaves so much humour into the way it's designed. On top of that, the cast and dialogue is so terrible it's enjoyable - stereotypical characters with dumb dialogue and predictable emotions lead to stale scenes that harken back to older horror movies and their uncomfortable silences and awkward moments. Granted, there are scenes where the movie does take itself seriously, though not too much to throw off the meta vibes.<br/><br/>This was definitely an odd film for me to watch, but I'll definitely make this a keeper for how it turned out. Bruce Campbell definitely drives the film and manages to bring a new energy to it that helps reinforce this parody concept. Give it a try and look at if from my perspective than what the tags define it as, and you might like it.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Greetings again from the darkness. The horror-comedy genre boasts many movies that can be described as 'a blast' or 'a wild ride'. Director Casey Tebo and writer Andy Greskoviak wisely jump on a topic that lends itself all too well to this genre: the whole mess we call Black Friday shopping. Ingeniously setting this in a toy store (\"We Love Toys\"), focusing on the stressed-out employees, and assembling what seems like the perfect cast, the filmmakers somehow come up short, due mostly to a paucity of effective one-liners and visual gags so necessary in a project like this.<br/><br/>Devon Sawa (FINAL DESTINATION, 2000) stars as Ken, the divorced father who is pained at having to drop his kids at his ex-wife's house as he heads in for his Black Friday shift at the store. We are then introduced to others on the store staff, including Ivana Baquero (Ofelia in the Guillermo del Toro instant classic PAN'S LABYRINTH, 2006) as Marnie, Ryan Lee (SUPER 8, 2011) as germophobe Chris, Michael Jai White (SPAWN, 1997) as Archie the maintenance guy, and Stephen Peck as Bryan, the power-abusing Assistant Manager. Leading this group of misfits is the always-great Bruce Campbell (the EVIL DEAD franchise) as Jonathan, the Store Manager and corporate lackey.<br/><br/>In an early scene we hear a TV newscast that forewarns of an upcoming meteor event, and the science fiction element involves a gooey alien creature/substance that causes even more turmoil than the shortages of this year's must-have toys. Shoppers are transformed into zombie-flesh-eating-alien-mutants, and the toy store staff teams up in an effort to stay alive. All of the actors do their part. Sawa is effective as the leader, while Baquero lends a strong female presence. White is the epitome of a nail-gun toting action hero, and Campbell delivers his comic force while donning a bow-tie and cardigan. The special effects work, and the only thing missing are searing and cutting quips and one-liners that would complete the picture.<br/><br/>ZOMBIELAND (2009), PRIDE AND PREJUDICE AND ZOMBIES (2016), THE DEAD DON'T DIE (2019), and READY OR NOT (2019) are all films in this genre that actually delivered what this one should have ... what it teased. One Air Supply joke and a riff on corporate greed and out-of-control entitled holiday shoppers was a tremendous idea that would have benefitted from more humorous social commentary. It's a letdown that may yet find a place the Midnight Movie slot.<br/><br/>Available in theaters and On Demand beginning November 19, 2021.</div>\n",

On the characters and story, the writing was bad also because the situation is handled as if the events happen every week which made it surreal &amp; detached (in a bad way)... Also the music score gets annoying (its like a Home Alone score).. Now all this would not bothered me when the writing was good! The writer should've watched 1992 \"Braindead\" (my fav horror-comedy!) which has the absurdism, sarcasm and over the top gore this movie needed badly! Watch Braindead instead, avoid this!</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Preparing for a Black Friday sale, the workers at a toy store find their sales halted when the customers turn into a series of ravenous, brain-eating zombies transformed by an alien parasite that arrived on a surprise meteor shower and must secure the store before falling to the creatures.<br/><br/>While there's a lot to like, this one also has a bit of a disappointing air to it. When this one comes off the best is the general setup of the alien parasite arriving at the store and taking over the customers the way they do. Taking the metaphor to its literal conclusion of a swarm of zombie-like inhabitants that crawl over the store taking everything they can get their hands on, the change-over that takes place once it's revealed that the creatures are being directed towards an ulterior motive being in the store and creating the giant blog-like mass that permeates inside the store throughout the film. This kind of structure is quite appealing and impressive which has a rather fun reveal as well as attached to it that makes this one somewhat intriguing. Alongside the setup, the films' best aspects are its zombie attacks and make-up effects. When the zombies attack others and rip them apart, this one has a lot of fun with the swarm overtaking the store, filling out the aisles, and grabbing onto whatever they can dragging them away in a massive blood-pool to emerge from the attack. With the series of attacks trying to get away leading to some decent confrontations in the storage room, an escape from the back of a supply truck, and the finale out in the store parking lot all generating some excitement, the action here is overall all right enough that there are some positives. As well with the great zombie effects for the creatures and the gore present, this has some great points about it although there are some problems to be had with this one. The main feature that holds this back is the treatment of the zombies here that tends to place them on a different style of behavior than most others out there in the genre. With the revelation that they're not directly attacking the group stuck in the store but more indirectly attacking them only as a means of believing that the store-workers are interfering with their single-minded goal of building the strange device at the heart of their plans. This means that the film takes them off the hunt for large portions of the running time to the point where had the group not ventured out of hiding nothing would've happened and removes a lot of the tension from this one considerably. That also ties into the other big drawback here in that there's a lot of downtime detailing the characters and their relationships which aren't necessary and stop the momentum of the film cold. With the big sequence that has the group sitting around the circle sharing a meal and telling stories about how they came to work at the store, the character-building that occurs at this point here comes at the detriment of the action as there's not a lot to like about how dragged out and underwhelming it all is at this point. As well, there's also how much it changes the characters due to injecting the type of unwarranted drama which attempts to make them relatable but doesn't do that, causing this one to be much lower than what it is.<br/><br/>Rated Unrated/R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language.</div>\n",

Without giving away any jokes for enjoyment - there were a lot of things to make fun of and the contemporary references were spot on. For this kind of movie they did as good a job as possible given the subject matter.<br/><br/>Compared to other spoof movies its less corny and slapstick. Of course there are some exaggerated parts and overkill on certain jokes but overall it was well done. It was nice that they used famous dialog from the movies to spoof like \"about 3 things I was certain\" and \"i know what you are ...\" They of course had to combine and condense the stories of 2 long movies into one and it was quite cleverly done. Left me wishing could have spoofed even more scenes.<br/><br/>The leads are good. Jenn Proske gets K Stew's mannerisms down well maybe she does them a little too often. Matt Lanter gets the Edward broody look quite well and looks the part. Chris Riggi as Jacob is OK and the vampire trio are good. Some of the supporting cast are a bit insipid like the Sullens. And some Volturri could have been better cast.<br/><br/>The familiar scenes were well recreated - forest, Bella's room, school etc. Clothing was well copied. Didn't have a cheap feel at all. It was fun to see how well they recreated things like the truck accident etc.<br/><br/>Overall watch it if you are a Twilight fan. I think a lot of critics weren't fans of the series so of course they found it boring.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Becca, an anxious, non-vampire teen, is torn between two boys. Before she can choose, Becca must get around her controlling father, who embarrasses Becca by treating her like a child. Meanwhile, Becca's friends contend with their own romantic issues – all of which collide at the prom.<br/><br/>VAMPIRES SUCK will surprise many people because it's an improvement over the previous spoof films directors Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer have been churning out for the past couple of years. However, that's like saying it's the better crap of all crap. The jokes still aren't funny and the filmmakers still don't realize the difference between satirizing and copying. But I would be lying to myself if I said I didn't find some good that came out of this film because there are some improvements.<br/><br/>First of all, the performances are great by the two leads. In her first film, Jenn Proske does a dead on impersonation of Kristen Stewart. However, it's sad to see her in this because I think she's better than this. Matt Lanter also does a great impersonation of Robert Pattinson in his \"pain\" look. I don't know what made Ken Jeong come aboard the film but he's basically playing the same character in THE HANGOVER. He's not in the film that much, though. Also, I think it's pretty great that Carmen Electra isn't in here and I'm sure others will agree.<br/><br/>The second obvious thing that stuck out to me was that the film focused on only the first two TWILIGHT films. The filmmakers finally learned that spoofing 600 movies is a bad thing. Saying that, the film still does have the many pop culture references, some too random to comment about. Fortunately, they really did tone it down quite a bit compared to the previous films where you get one every five seconds. You probably get one every five minutes here.<br/><br/>I also liked the fact that it looked like an actual film because if you saw MEET THE SPARTANS and DISASTER MOVIE, you'd know the films were filled with shoddy sets made up in ten minutes. In here, you might question if they stole the sets and locations from the TWILIGHT films. I don't know if this counts as something good but I really think the film manages to create a decent storyline from the first two TWILIGHT films.<br/><br/>Overall, the film is still bad because it's rarely funny, although I will admit I laughed at some bits that took a jab at the TWILIGHT series. If the story is better than the jokes itself, you know you got a bad comedy. It's an improvement from the last few spoof films, but that doesn't say much. I really don't recommend seeing it at all. If you must, just rent it on DVD that will inevitably come out a month after the film is released.</div>\n",

The supposed spoofs are not even spoofs, but are just re-enactment of scenes from \"Twilight\" and \"New Moon\". The story is an amalgamation of the two films, but it is fragmented and incoherent.

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Being directed by the directors/writers of films such as the Scary Movie films, Epic Movie, Meet the Spartans, etc., I knew that Vampires Suck won't be good at all, and just when I was getting tired of these kind of films, I didn't need it to. I only wanted to see this because it parodies the crappiest crap in the history of crap literature and crap film. I saw it, didn't really like it, but I was surprised - It made fun of Twilight, yet it was better than it in every single way! Like I do with the other spoof films, I only watched this for some hilarity (which some of you should do instead of bashing it). I couldn't help but burst out laughing at all the jokes, even if some of them were predictable. It doesn't only parodize Twilight, but pokes a tongue at the monotony of teenagers girls who are all manipulative narcissists, or a soldier of \"Team Jacob\".<br/><br/>Compared to the forced acting in Twilight, the acting in this was Leonardo DiCaprio good. Their timing was perfect, they actually had facial expressions and varied their voice. Cough cough, Kristen. Cough cough.<br/><br/>The good thing is that it was less boring than Twilight. It didn't waste its time on boring, senseless conversations - It was more \"action-packed\", it had more blood, the vampires actually seemed like vampires, and yes - You will see its astonishing horrible special effects that you always find in the other spoof films! Futheremore, the ending was epic!!! Let's just put it at that - One of the greatest film endings of all time...<br/><br/>I think this is the second best spoof movie that I have seen (Spaceballs) being the first. You should give it a try, you won't be disappointed if you know what's coming.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Oh, Friedberg and Seltzer. How woefully you are viewed upon by over half the film world's population today. The films you have made have been deemed some of the worst ever. However, there are still some traces of fans out there, whether anyone believes it or not. I, myself, am certainly not a fan, but I understand both sides of the scale and review your films unbiasedly. With that said, I have to admit that I rather enjoyed the latest spoof from these two.<br/><br/>The Twilight phenomenon is an utter joke among many already. A feature length spoof of the movies seemed like it was bound to happen, but who would have known it would have been created by them. Some might enjoy this because they find any mocking of the Twlight films joyous. Some might enjoy this because they honestly find the antics humorous. Most will hate it entirely because of the directors. In any matter, I found it fun because of how well crafted I actually thought it was and how many times it made me laugh because of how funny the movie managed to be by working off the films' it mocks cheesiness areas.<br/><br/>Like some have already reviewed saying, this is an improvement in many ways. Unlike all their other films, this actually focuses on spoofing just the two first Twilight films and does not rely on criticizing every film they possibly can as well as making lame pop culture reference after lame pop culture reference to get giggles, even though there still are pop culture references in there, they're just not as lame and are spaced out for our brain's convenience.<br/><br/>Jenn Proske and Matt Lanter are actually incredible, in a sense, in their performances. Proske covered every Kristen Stewart fault swimmingly as did Matt Lanter for Robert Pattinson. Even though that's generally not something to be proud of, it works here. The movie doesn't linger on humorless side jokes until the point where boredom is spewing out of our mouths, and the crew captures the essence that I was looking for in this film. Yes, it has many problems, what Friedberg and Seltzer film doesn't? It still is entertaining in the right mood, and just maybe the two have finally started to perfect on what they have been oblivious to all this time, or maybe I have just gotten used to their mediocrity, but regardless, I think this film deserves more appreciation than some Friedberg and Seltzer haters will give it.</div>\n",

Objectively, the movie is bad and ridiculous, but unlike the original, which with a budget of $ 400 million and serious intentions turned out to be bad, stupid and boring, this one with dozens of times smaller budget is deliberately bad and stupid and immeasurably entertaining. They dug up actors who mostly resemble those from the original franchise and mimic them pretty well, and Jenn Proske is both hotter and a better actress than gloomy Kristen Stewart's she skillfully mocks.

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">I wouldn't have watched this if not for a friend who wanted to catch a comedy together, though I must admit I'm still pretty intrigued and amazed at how writer-directors Jason Friedberg and Adam Seltzer managed to continue get money thrown at them to make terrible, unfunny comedies such as sub par works like Meet the Spartans, Disaster Movie, Epic Movie and Date Movie, the last which to me was mildly amusing. Gone are the days of the Zucker brothers, and now we're stuck with low-brow efforts like what Friedberg and Seltzer continuously dish out, setting their sights at whatever's popular genre at the moment.<br/><br/>And that of course is the phenomenon we call Twilight, where it's already three films old, and taking its cue from the Harry Potter franchise, decided to split its last book into two films, done squarely for profits. Poking fun at something popular is expected, but to do so in the Friedberg-Seltzer fashion just reeks of desperation. They seem to throw anything and everything into the film, without even due consideration if it's funny, or not. There are plenty of sight gags, innuendos, and just plain badly designed scenes that don't flow from one to another, making it look like a series of school children skits that got strung together, hammering wooden pegs into rounded holes, and jokes that's 99% bad, you'll find more pleasure from experiencing long nails clawed against a chalkboard.<br/><br/>Even more curious is the demographics out to support / watch this film. As I was understandably surrounded by women of all ages who turn out in droves to watch the Twilight movies, I was again equally surrounded by the same demographics for this one in a near full house. Clearly, I don't think they're that vacuous to, for a moment, think that their highly anticipated sequel film had arrived, or even remotely suspect that this is a companion film. I suspect though that for all the spoof movies out there, there's always a great chance that the impersonators of their favourite yummy characters will look equally yummy. Sorry to burst your bubble, but Matt Lanter as Edward Sullen is miles away from Robert Pattinson as Edward Cullen even though both cannot act, and Chris Riggi as Jacob White is not Taylor Lautner as Jacob Black even though both share equal number of pronounced abs (hmm... maybe this could be a reason, Team Jacob was actually out supporting this?). <br/><br/>The only thing that was the rare shining light in this film, happens to be Jenn Proske as Becca Crane, who did an awesome job impersonating how Kristen Stewart would play Bella Swan, down to all the subtle nuances that if Stewart decides to leave her role, then the Twilight producers can plonk Proske right in. It's really uncanny watching her ham up the Bella spoof, but do note that I'm not praising her performance either as she's just carbon-copying what another actress had done, although pitch perfect.<br/><br/>I did laugh out loud here and there, but it's laughing at the film in how it got away with the stupidest of jokes and the absurdity at who this project could have been green lit by a Hollywood studio (says a lot, doesn't it?) I hope Friedberg and Seltzer either learn from the best in the comedic business, or quit filmmaking altogether. Vampires Suck sucks. Period. And I'm just feeling dirty having to recount what I had watched, and to craft a review for it.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer are the single worst filmmakers currently working in the realm of mainstream cinema. This pair of writers/directors is responsible for single-handedly destroying the parody genre. I consider their third film, Meet the Spartans, to be the single worst movie of the last decade – one which gave us a dozen well known and lesser known treasures by Uwe Boll. But where Boll shows ambition and dare I say, \"style\", Friedberg and Seltzer exhibit laziness and a lack of purpose. These two hacks throw in dated pop culture references and steal the work of others, and seem to get away with calling it comedy.<br/><br/>It is funny to note then that their first movie in two years, Vampires Suck, is a parody riffing on the Twilight series. The duo gleefully crib from Twilight and New Moon, providing us with the tale of new girl Becca (Jenn Proske) who falls in love with the vampire Edward (Matt Lanter), and all the problems that come with their newfound romance.<br/><br/>My immediate question, before even beginning to try and discuss this waste of time, is why did Friedberg and Seltzer ever think it was a good idea to make a parody of the Twilight series? The films are unintentionally hilarious as it is. And True Blood has been on for three seasons now, and for all intents and purposes, it is merely a darkly satirical and much more adult version of Twilight. So right off the bat, these two brilliant minds are mining at something that has already been done. I guess it was money, but who would knowingly believe Twilight fans would rush out to see a movie bashing their beloved franchise much less the haters who would not be caught dead seeing the film as it is? <br/><br/>It just seems overly baffling to me, what could possibly have made anyone think this film is a good idea. It recycles the unintentional jokes from the series, and packages them in a way that either rips them off lightly or just come off as not being anywhere near as funny as they were before. I chuckled at a few parts here and there, but they were only mild chuckles. There is nothing inherently funny or stands out as being hilarious at any given point in the film. Perhaps Friedberg and Seltzer are laughing – but no one else is laughing with them. I had the good fortune of not having to see this movie in a theatre, but I can imagine the film's showings are silent enough that the filmgoers can hear the projector whirling more than they can hear anyone laughing.<br/><br/>I will give credit however in the fact that unlike their previous atrocities and crimes against cinema-goers all over the world, Vampires Suck does not deviate from its riffing of the Twilight. Characters still make dated pop culture references (is anyone in five years even going to remember The Kardashians? I barely know who they are now), but no one from other films is just thrown into the film at random. The film never stops to suddenly jump into making fun of another film or franchise (outside of a total throwaway blink-and-you-will-miss-it gag involving Alice from Alice in Wonderland). It stays consistent throughout, and to me, suggests a minor development of maturity on the parts of the filmmakers. Or of course, they realized there was nowhere they could possibly throw someone like Justin Bieber or Cobb from Inception, and not confuse the audience even more than they like already are.<br/><br/>But this consistency comes with a price. Instead of whipping by, the film runs at an incredibly slow pace. I fell asleep twice, and somehow barely missed anything. They do a fairly nifty job of condensing the first two films, but it seems like they did not do nearly enough editing and whittling down. The film easily could have felt a lot faster paced, but it stalls a bit too much in almost every scene. And for a film that runs less than eighty minutes, it speaks a lot for what these two filmmakers were trying to accomplish or even what they wanted to show. If they cannot answer that simple question to the filmgoing public, then what is the point of even making movies in the first place? <br/><br/>You will need to sift through the increasing amount of junk and waste in Vampires Suck, but Proske is actually fairly good in her role (her acting debut, sadly). She has the Kristen Stewart impression and mannerisms down perfectly, and she almost came off as a better Bella than Stewart ever has. She also has a commanding aura about her, which suggests she is in store for much greater work in the future. As long as she runs away from everyone involved here, I am sure she can prove this soon enough. Unlike her, no one else even remotely stands out or is even half decent in the cast (Ken Jeong and Diedrich Bader go to complete waste in supporting roles). They all just go through the motions, and are just as lazy and half-assed as everyone else. But then, why should they bother if the filmmakers do not even try? <br/><br/>Despite being a lot more balanced than any of their brethren, Vampires Suck is still an awful and truly unfunny film that only further proves the point that Friedberg and Seltzer need to stop making movies. Even with a great lead, they still manage to botch the making of this film and still suffer from many of the problems their earlier films were plagued by. Years from now, will anyone even remember these films? Better yet, will anyone want to remember these films? <br/><br/>2/10.<br/><br/>(This review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com).</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">I saw this movie at a Halloween Party. By no means is this movie great art, but those of us watching had a few good laughs at this skewering of the Twilight saga. Pretty good performances from the leads. I thought the actress playing Becca was particularly good. Great Bella Swan impersonation. The script and production values were definitely B movie level. As long as you're not expecting too much, this is a light, frothy movie to see with your friends on Halloween. It's a bit like reading a trashy novel at the beach.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">My wife is a complete, total, and obsessed Twihard. She's read the books many times and seen the movies uncounted times, and gets all of her girl friends into it too. While I can admit that there are some good qualities to the movies (they are immensely popular after all), it all just gets to be a bit too much after a while. This movie gives a great outlet for those who are tired of the Twilight movies and want to laugh about it.<br/><br/>The whole point of the movie is to loosely follow the original plot to set up zippy one-liners and make fun of pretty much everything about the original movies. This basically works, many parts of the originals really are completely ridiculous and very spoof-worthy. This movie drags in some places and some of the lines fall completely flat, but hey it isn't intended to be a piece of art. It is all pretty low-brow slapstick humor and I got the impression it was done in a hurry, but I had at least 10 full belly laughs.<br/><br/>I can't imagine how Jenn Proske kept a straight face delivering some of her lines, and she must have spent time studying Kristen Stewart's acting, because she does a perfect exaggeration of Stewart's little pouty angsty faces. She even has the hand gestures down. It makes you realize how good of an actress Stewart is, to be able to play the same note again and again and make it convincing, but it is a delight to see it mocked too.<br/><br/>Many of the scenes are nearly exact replicas of the originals, and you can tell that the cast had fun getting the details right.<br/><br/>It definitely started to drag at the end but hey if you want an hour's worth of Twilight recovery, it's definitely worth it.<br/><br/>BTW if you like this and want to see more, see Colt Ford's video for \"Chicken &amp; Biscuits\".<br/><br/>I was surprised at the low ratings for this movie here, reading the reviews, it sounds like some people didn't even realize that it was a parody. I think it only makes sense if you saw (or were forced to see) the Twilight movies and got tired of them. If you really liked the originals and don't like to see fun being poked at your favorite characters, or if you just don't like dumb slapstick humor, you might not like this one.</div>\n",

I know from painful, bitter experience just how bad they've become over the years with Date Movie being singled out for particular attention at just how something so bad ever got released being beyond human comprehension! So it was with a huge amount of trepidation and bribing from my friend that I went along to see this and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>Lets get it out there right now, it's not, nor will it ever be Academy Award material. The hint after all is in the genre name, it's a \"spoof\" movie, and to that end it lives up pretty well to expectation. There's the usual un-PC like jokes in there (baby and bowling ball spring to mind), the relatively unknown ensemble who end up doing a better job than the original cast. Jenn Proske as Becca Crane has Kristen Stewart's awkward-ness down to a tee, whilst Matt Lanter is a far hotter Edward than Robert Pattinson!<br/><br/>True Twi-hards will HATE it with a vengeance, as it stereotypes everything bad about Twilight including the whole ongoing Team Edward/Team Jacob debate, and they'll definitely hate the ending, although I laughed my head off!<br/><br/>Yes it's completely juvenile humour, yes there are glaring omissions in the script, it sometimes feels rushed, like they didn't know how to work a certain scene, so just grazed over it in their hurry to film another scene that they had worked on, but it's bloody good fun if you're just looking for a film where you don't need to think, and you're wanting to kill an hour or so of your time</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Normally, I don't review movies on here, but when I read everyone else slamming this movie, I thought maybe they should get the perspective of someone who enjoyed it.<br/><br/>As a non-Twilight fan (haven't read the books and don't wish to for reasons to numerous to mention), I was determined to see this movie at the time when I wanted to tease a Twi-hard that I personally got to know from my disability social group about it. She refused to see this movie simply because they make fun of Twilight and Buffy, which motivated me even further.<br/><br/>First off, yes, there were a lot of corny sex jokes, fart jokes, pop culture and celebrity references that many reviewers said wore out their welcome with projects like Epic Movie and Meet the Spartans. That may be true, but think about this for a minute. We are talking about a franchise that has spent 500 or so pages going on and on about Edward Cullen's \"great\" looks, using every descriptive synonym known to man, resulting in the most annoying teenyboppers since Benji and Joel Madden put the oh-so-overrated Good Charlotte on the music map, them and the Jonas Brothers. Ask anyone who has hated the Twilight series from the start, or started to hate it once they got through their Twilight-gushing phase (in other words, they grew up and developed literary taste!) Neither the books nor the movies deserve even a quarter of the recognition they got, because all the people behind it want you to focus on is how a naive, despairing, depressed girl who doesn't know what she wants getting into a love triangle with a fairy vampire and a werewolf. That and how gorgeous Robert Pattinson looks in his sparkles and pale makeup, and the same with Taylor Lautner in his shirtless scenes. The result: hordes of groupie girls going so far as to unrealistically want to have Edward Cullen and Jacob Black's children, despite the fact they are fictional characters. It's ridiculous and absurd, to say the least! <br/><br/>This is why \"Vampires Suck\" can be halfway appreciated. You can easily laugh at the jokes in this movie because even those who hated it know that this highly overrated saga had this coming all along. And for the aforementioned crimes that this literary atrocity committed, the Twilight saga got the bashing and ridicule it so richly deserved.<br/><br/>So if you disliked it the first time because it made you think of the unfunny torture you experienced after flops like the Scary Movie franchise after the first movie, Disaster Movie, Date Movie, Epic Movie, Superhero Movie, and so on, I challenge you to watch this again when it comes out on DVD, and think about what the \"Twilight\" saga has done to the worlds of both literature and cinema. I guarantee you'll developa new appreciation for this particular one.</div>\n",

Another blissfully short effort from the modern Proft/Zucker, Vampire's Suck keeps itself moving just by not having any illusions about itself and just being enjoyably silly through-out, without the gross unpleasantness of Disaster Movie or just the lameness of Epic Movie. It keeps itself in the times by the obligatory pop culture references, including a politically incorrect pop at Lady Gaga...I don't want to talk like it's some great masterpiece, but by S &amp; F's standards, you can't complain. ***</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">In IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 list, there are many movies like \"Vampire Suck\". \"Disaster Movie\", \"Epic Movie\", \"Date Movie\", \"Starving Games\", Scary Movie 5\" and \"Fifty Shades of Black\" are all essentially the same film. They all provide bad jokes in rapid-fire manner. So, when one unfunny joke falls flat, they then go on to the next unfunny joke...and along the way make LOTS of unwanted references to pop culture. I have no idea why they make them and I wonder who would pay to go see them....especially as they have a reputation of being terrible. Is \"Vampires Suck\" just as bad as the rest...most likely yes, as it's #44 on the list. I have made it a goal to see all the Bottom 100 and, fortunately, this is the last of these dreadful parody films I have to see. And, like the rest, I did not see them in a theater...I am not THAT desperate to see the Bottom 100!<br/><br/>This film primarily is focused on making fun of the \"Twilight\" movie franchise...which should be easy and fun. Unfortunately, it really isn't...and you can only assume that lemurs made this movie. It's unfunny from start to finish and occasionally is very distasteful...though less than most of these sorts of films.<br/><br/>So did I enjoy any of it? Not much...and that came as no surprise. Unlike older comedies like \"Airplane\" or \"Hot Shots\", which had rapdi-fire jokes that actually worked, this one is as artless and dull as the rest of the recent pile of crap that studios are making for particularly undemanding young adults. Anyone over about 20 would find the films dopey....and I felt myself getting stupider the more I watched. Sadly, the film DID make money...so I assume they'll keep making more like it.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">After making the woefully regrettable decision to pay money to see \"Epic Movie\", I had vowed to stay far away from this movie and any other with the word \"Movie\" in the title. But, because I am faint of heart and/or an idiot, I allowed myself to be talked into watching a leaked version online because A) it was actually pretty funny, according to friends who had seen it already, B) it was only about 70 minutes long, and C) this Edward was actually hot. After watching it for myself, I would agree on all three counts (especially C",
      ".daaaaamn). It's no great cinematic achievement, but for a devoted Twilight hater such as myself, it was worth a chuckle or two.<br/><br/>Sure, \"Vampires Suck\" meets many of the same pitfalls other parody movies do. It operates under the delusion that anyone out of diapers thinks that a character being bludgeoned over the head time and time again for absolutely no reason is comedy gold. It often relies on stupid pop culture jokes (Look! A Jersey Shore reference! It's funny because it is a Jersey shore reference!) and unoriginal gross-out humor (it's funny because you want to vomit! Haha!). But, so help me if I didn't find myself laughing at the way the film mercilessly mocks everything laughable about the Twilight movies, a series that, let's face it, lends itself pretty easily to parody. In fact, all \"Vampires Suck\" really had to do was recreate the first two Twilight films pretty much scene-for-scene, tweaking here and there to make the scenes only slightly more ridiculous than the originals. The result is actually a pretty clever send-up of the ludicrously over-the-top melodrama that Twilight lovers eat up. This film holds a mirror up to pretty much everything laughable about the series that proves that a wildly successful book/movie franchise does not necessarily need a \"plot\": the rabidity of its fan base; the shameless parade of shirtless males; the idea that teenage Stephanie Meyer",
      "er, I mean, Bella, would be the object of every hot guy's lust despite being a mopy sourpuss with no trace of a personality; the insistence that Robert Pattinson is \"sexy\". The actress who plays Bella, or \"Becca,\" as she is renamed, does a killer job parodying Kristen Stewart's mannerisms (hair-tucking, downward gazes, constant lower-lip biting) by which I mean she mimics them exactly and everyone laughs at them because they are stupid. Mocking Twilight is not exactly hard to do, but I have to say this film does it quite cleverly at many points. I'll even say that the ending is magnificent.<br/><br/>Needless to say, \"Vampires Suck\" is for members of Team I Want a Boy Who Doesn't Want to Kill Me only, as I'm sure Twilight fans would not appreciate being forced to acknowledge that the thing they love is dumber than a sack of fruit fly larvae. However, since like I said the movie is pretty much just a re-creation of the original Twilight movies, many of the jokes are best appreciated having actually seen them. So you'll probably like this movie if you are not a Twilight fan, but have actually seen the movies because A) you were dragged there by a girl whose pants you really, REALLY wanted to get into, B) you were stoned, walked into the wrong theater, and failed to realize that it wasn't The Hangover until it was too late, or C) you are self-loathing and willingly subjected yourself to them out of morbid curiosity (like me).<br/><br/>So if you hate Twilight and everything it stands for, take a break from your violent (yet strangely erotic) fantasies about Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lautner and go see \"Vampires Suck\". It will ease your tortured soul, and maybe, just maybe, restore a molecule of faith in the parody genre. It couldn't possibly be worse than \"Meet the Spartans\".</div>\n",

If the viewer likes this type of joke and sees the movie with low expectations, he or she will probably enjoy \"Vampire Sucks\". The name of the town, Sporks, means a hybrid form of cutlery with the form of a spoon-like shallow scoop with the addition of three or four tines of a fork; therefore another hilarious joke with the name of Forks.

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">I have made no secret of hating the movies of Jason Friedburg and Aaron Seltzer. Their movies to me are poorly structured, poorly written, terribly acted, and just come across as a waste of time. From reading this sentence and my reviews on them you may be wondering why I watched Vampires Suck in the first place. Simple, out of curiosity. I wanted to see whether Friedberg and Seltzer had gotten better or were further losing the plot.<br/><br/>Although I was very unimpressed overall, I have to say it is a slight improvement over their previous efforts. A year ago I would have said Date Movie was their best(very faint praise though) but after seeing Vampires Suck I have changed my mind. This is their best, but it is still barely average.<br/><br/>I will get onto the good things before the many bad things. Now I saw it to see how well or not it poked fun of Twilight. Just for the record, I don't hate the Twilight movies as much as others do, but I have never understood their popularity either. In Vampires Suck, the costume and set design are actually spot on, the previous movies especially Disaster Movie look like straight to video fodder. Also Matt Lanter gives a dead on impression as Edward Sullen, as does Jenn Proske as Becca. Also, while I may sound mean here, I am glad Carmen Electra is not in this, she is the epitome of all looks, no talent to me so I was kind of pleased not to see her grating presence dragging the film down any further.<br/><br/>However, that's where the redeeming qualities end. The story is very disjointed and almost non-existent, while the humour is another let-down. There are a scatter of surprising laughs here and there, but never anything hilarious or anything consistent to make it even funnier. The direction is patchy too, and that is being kind, while the soundtrack while definitely not as bad this time around is forgettable. The two leads are fine, however the other acting is nothing to write home about at all really, nobody else stood out. Pacing is an issue too; admittedly pacing was a big weakness in the Twilight movies as well as the clunky dialogue, but as Vampires Suck was never that funny the pedestrian pacing made the experience somewhat exhausting.<br/><br/>In conclusion, a marginal improvement but it is very faint praise. For me it is still one of the worst movies of 2010. 3/10 Bethany Cox</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Son of the Mask is one of those sequels that simply shouldn't have happened and now after watching I can claim it's a contender for the worst one of the bunch.<br/><br/>But no wait there is more, this isn't just bad it's THAT bad.<br/><br/>It currently sits as the 10th worst movie ever made on IMDB which is an impressive feat. Ontop of that it's the winner of such prestigious awards as Worst Picture, Worst Director, Worst Actor, Most Intrusive Musical Score, Foulest Family Film, Most Painfully Unfunny Comedy and Least \"Special\" Special Effects. <br/><br/>Starring Jamie Kennedy, Traylor Howard, Alan Cumming and a small role for Kal Penn it tells another story of the infamous Mask and it is beyond belief.<br/><br/>Full of dire cgi, painfully unfunny \"comedy\", purile writing and legitimately no redeeming features I can't believe that such a brilliant classic comedy like The Mask (1994) could be insulted to this degree with a sequel.<br/><br/>It's just SO cringe inducing! The jokes are too immature even for Saturday morning cartoons. The cartoon violence doesn't translate very well at all and some of it seems distasteful especially for a family film. And for 84 million dollars it looks like warmed up dog poop.<br/><br/>Seriously, everything people say about this film is true. I'm not one to jump aboard bandwagons and hate things because its \"Trendy\" to, nor do I give 1/10's out often but this is awful!<br/><br/>The Good:<br/><br/>Traylor Howard <br/><br/>The Bad:<br/><br/>Poor cgi<br/><br/>Beyond dumb<br/><br/>Things I Learnt From This Movie:<br/><br/>In movies reducing women down to their bras is funny and comedic, I do it and I get arrested!?<br/><br/>How could a plot including repeated attempts on a babies life not be considered funny?

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Eleven years ago, Stanley Ipkiss released his true inner self and became the hero of Edge City by finding and wearing the Norse god of mischief, Loki's mask. The Mask helped bring Jim Carrey to the forefront of comedy and reached a very popular status for its originality and just pure fun. Everyone knew how to spell party. P-A-R-T-Y. Why? Cuz I gotta! Now, eleven years later, it seems to me that the same philosophy has been applied to the new movie \"Son of the Mask.\" Someone asked director Lawrence Guterman why are you making this? And he responds \"Cuz I gotta!\" Unfortunately, that answer doesn't cover it because after seeing Son of the Mask I still left the theatre thinking, \"Good Lord, Why?\" Guterman and the rest of the people involved in the blasphemous film need to realize that the response given to why are you making this film should not be as simple as the answer to the debate on whether or not to party.<br/><br/>The Son of the Mask begins with Otis the dog finding the infamous mask and bringing it back to his owner Tim Avery, a clear homage to legendary Loony Toons creator Tex Avery. Tim, played by Jamie Kennedy, is a struggling animator who is stuck working as a turtle tour guide for the animation company he aspires to one-day draw for. On the night of the company Halloween party, Tim puts on the mask and transforms into the mischievous, insane character that we all expect. After the party Tim goes home, mask still on and conceives a child with his wife. Nine months later mayhem ensues as the baby born of the mask has remarkable cartoonish powers. Otis the dog, jealous of the baby's attention, puts on the mask and partakes in Tom and Jerry type mayhem to out the baby. Meanwhile, Loki, played by Alan Cumming, is in search for his mask at the orders of his father, Odin.<br/><br/>First off, ill admit that I do respect the fact that this film pays so much homage to the classic cartoons such as Tom and Jerry and Loony Toons, with its Wile E. Coyote type contraptions and the infamous dancing frog type plot. However, this reverence cannot save the film and makes it less respectful and more of a waste of time.<br/><br/>The premise of the movie becomes increasingly silly. Silly is not always a bad thing, but in this movie, the silliness gets to the point of just plain annoying. The characters are not fun to watch, and what's worse, they're not funny. The dullness of the characters can also be attributed to the fact that so much CGI was used. One of the greatest things about the original is that while, obviously computer animation was used, so much relied on Jim Carrey and his exuberant style of just being. Jim Carrey, we were convinced, was an actual cartoon. Jamie Kennedy just doesn't have that kind of ability, a fact that is clear when you watch him wear the mask and his facial features rarely shift. The baby and dog were mostly completely animated which became increasingly distracting throughout the movie. The side story of Loki searching for the mask just became more and more stupefying.<br/><br/>The son of the Mask is a sad sad state of affairs. What I suggest is you go rent or buy the original the Mask and thank the Norse gods, or whoever, for bringing it to us. And will consider seeing the sequel my sacrifice as I continue to ask the infamous question \"WHY?\" The son of the Mask gets one star, although that star should be divvied up between the classic creators of Loony Toons and Jim Carrey, who will always be, in my book, the mask.</div>\n",

It seems these days that if there is a buck to be made, movie execs will dig up an old hit and run it by a set of writers and see what turns up. (Hey, I said \"hit and run\"! Kinda describes how I felt when this movie ended!) How THIS piece of trash ever saw the light of day is beyond me. It is filled with unpleasant humor, strange animation and jokes that don't quite take you anywhere besides a state of confusion. If you are being dragged to this movie, and someone is paying for you....fine.... but its still going to be more painful than a brick in the forehead. However, if you're planning on paying your own hard-earned money, search out a better alternative.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">This is one of those Hollywood projects that makes you wonder why they even made the film in the first place. After all, to anyone hearing the plot, they'd know that the film was destined to bomb--yet some lunkheads approved the picture. And, while they saved a huge amount of money by not getting Jim Carey for this sequel, it's obvious that the budget was NOT small when you look at the amazing sets and see the excellent special effects. Yet, oddly, despite all this money being spent, the fundamental story idea was so stupid and the writing so amateurish that it couldn't help but bomb...and thankfully it did...otherwise they might have made more sequels!!! This is a bad film--there is no doubt about this. However, I object to it being on the IMDb Bottom 100 list as it's not THAT bad. Only the very worst of the worst deserve to be on the list--yet I notice such horrendous films as those of Ed Wood, Arch Hall, Al Adamson or William Grefe are not on the list! I guess it's because not as many people have seen these films and many DID see \"Son of the Mask\" due to its huge publicity campaign and massive DVD saturation.<br/><br/>In addition, you can't help but admire the special effects as well as the sets. In particular, I loved the sets--which were very surreal and cartoon-like. I can't see giving such a beautiful looking film a 1---it deserves at least another point or two for effects and sets.<br/><br/>As for the story, it's just plain stupid and wastes the talents of Alan Cumming and Bob Hoskins. Plus, odd for a comedy, the film hasn't got a single laugh--not even one. In fact, some of the 'jokes' are downright repellent--such as the baby peeing copiously on the father as well as the snot joke--which both managed to be unfunny AND gross.<br/><br/>While I could go on to discuss the plot, I won't...as simply put, no one could possibly care. It's dumb and not worth your trouble. An incredibly limp, unfunny and stupid film...with nice sets. Even smaller children will find all this very tedious and boring. Only for bad movie fans who want to marvel at the film's awfulness.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">The original film with Jim Carrey was a clever and hilarious film, with a very sophisticated and dynamic visual style. What a way to ruin such a fantastic film, with such a poor sequel? It does make me sad. I will give some credit, it isn't quite the worst movie I have ever seen, Disaster Movie, Superbabies:Baby Geniuses 2 and Home Alone 4 were worse, but judging by how really poor the film is, that is not saying much.<br/><br/>Let me start by saying the script was quite terrible, very clichéd and stale, with nothing new to expand from its predecessor. And the direction from Laurence Guterman, who also directed Cats and Dogs, which is much more decent, was close to incompetent. The story about the magical mask falling into the hands of a cartoonist who fathers a son is rather substandard and takes a while to get going.<br/><br/>The special effects and animation attempts to spark some imagination, but it completely lacks the visual style that made the original so endearing to look at. Intead the whole film looks cheap in comparison and looks like it was made for TV, despite the valiant attempts of the animators to make it look good. The casting is uninspired to say the least. Jamie Kennedy as the cartoonist lacks charisma, and I will say I found the baby really creepy. Alan Cumming is a very talented actor, and has been in some great films namely the wonderful 1994 version of Black Beauty where his voice over of the beloved horse was note perfect. Here he can't do anything with his villainous role, which is so badly underwritten it's not hard to see why. And how Bob Hoskins got dragged into this I shall never know.<br/><br/>All in all, I can see why people say this movie is bad, it is. Not just because it is not a true sequel but also it is substandard in comparison to its much superior predecessor in terms of sophistication and quality. Not quite the worst movie I have ever seen, but it is bad! 1/10 Bethany Cox</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">The Mask was in my opinion one of the most funniest Jim Carrey films in Carrey's career.It was over the top and downright hilarious. Rumors were going around that he was set to return and do another sequel opposite Cameron Diaz,but of course it wasn't meant to be. So fast forward to 2005 and we finally got a sequel to this film but is it as good as the 1994 version? Lets find out.<br/><br/>Jamie Kennedy plays Ted Avery a cartoonist who finds a mask near a river(as in the opening we see Loki at a museum where the mask was kept)and one night Ted decides to put it on for his work party. Of course he and his wife get it on while Ted has the mask on him and his wife is pregnant with a beautiful baby boy. But when the baby is born he of course acts odd since Ted had the mask on him and so his different compare to other kids as his all looney and quirky since his half normal and half mask. So will Loki(Alan Cunnings) find Ted and get the mask back off him.<br/><br/>Bottom line this film was so so stupid and awful. The CGI effects were rubbish,the CGI on the baby was just plain stupid,the acting was appalling. I just wanted to give up as I couldn't deal with it anymore.<br/><br/>Do yourselves a favour and go find Jim Carrey's version better at least that has better CGI effects and Carrey is miles better than Jamie Kennedy(from Ghost Whisper)who was just terrible.<br/><br/>0/10 <br/><br/>Piece of crap.<br/><br/>Alan Cunnings from The Smurfs and X Men 2 co stars as Loki and the late Bob Hospkins is in it too as Loki's father.And yes folks the guy that voices the tortoise in The Swan Princess Steve Wright is also in this film.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">\"The Mask\" took a gory and violent comic book and turned it into a funny and PG-13 comedy. It starred rubber faced Jim Carrey as an introverted bank employee that becomes a wild man with fantastic powers when he puts on the titular mask. He gets the girl, shows that he doesn't need the mask to be successful and roll credits. The movie was very popular, it did what it set out to do like bring a Tex Avery cartoon to life and made a lot of money. To this day it's still considered some of Jim Carrey's best work. So obviously there was a call to make a sequel to this. It bounced around a lot in Hollywood and Jim even turned down a $10 million paycheck because he didn't want to do a sequel to his work.<br/><br/>So a couple years later they announced that they were making a sequel starring nobody that was in the original movie. This time instead of the wild and crazy Jim Carrey they instead cast the relatively unfunny Jamie Kennedy. And it's like they took all the likability out of the movie and replaced it with really creepy CGI and jokes that didn't land properly.<br/><br/>The story goes that the mask has floated downstream from Edge City to Fringe City and has been found by a dog that looked remarkably like the dog from the original. His owner is played by Jamie Kennedy who's an aspiring cartoonist and a total manchild. Where Jim Carrey was eccentric and charming, this guy is just annoying. Well he puts on the mask, becomes a green faced wild man and wows everybody at the company Halloween party. They even rip off the musical numbers from the original but where they were funny and showed off Jim's abilities this one singular one really doesn't work. Like the dog the makers seem to think that if it worked in the original it will work here. Sadly it doesn't.<br/><br/>Up until now there could have been some decent movie to be pulled from this mess but it's called \"Son of the Mask\" for a reason. While wearing said mask he goes home to his wife and she winds up pregnant. The baby somehow has inherited the powers of the mask and shenanigans ensue.<br/><br/>The mother has morning sickness but instead of vomit what comes out is bubbles. I guess that's supposed to be funny. And she gets weird cravings. Like for silly string because the baby is silly I guess. Again I guess it's supposed to be funny.<br/><br/>The baby is born and now the movie takes a hard left turn into nightmare fuel. The baby is normal except when alone with his father and he suddenly becomes a CGI abomination. You want to talk about the uncanny valley? This kid is an uncanny black hole. He's beyond frightening but I guess he was supposed to be cute and adorable.<br/><br/>There's a side quest as Loki, the owner of the mask, is trying to find his mask and it erupts into chaos as he finds the child, the father and mother try to save him, there's a shtick-off where Loki and Jamie fight using wacky tricks and the baby finally chooses his father because he loves him now instead of literally wanting to send him to the insane asylum.<br/><br/>Cue the happy ending and the CGI baby winking to the camera as if to say, \"this isn't over\".<br/><br/>Thankfully this movie bombed at the box office and a third movie wasn't made and we never saw Jamie Kennedy in movies again.<br/><br/>Do not see this. Sure it might entertain kids but there are better movies out there for them.</div>\n",

It wasn't as dark as it's precedecessor, which made it more family friendly. But even as a family oriented movie, it was still corny. And it had it's funny moments with zaniness, but compared to the original film, it'll never be great.<br/><br/>The cast was pretty great actually, albeit Jamie Kennedy, still flying high from his hidden camera show, wasn't a good fit. But Bob Hoskins as Odin and Alan Cumming as Loki we're perfectly cast. Of course, both of them are great actors. Ben Stein makes a cameo as Dr. Neuman, the only link between the original film and this sequel besides the mask itself.</div>\n",

Watching this movie made me realized, how much I did not miss Jim Carrey from the first one. The effects are incredible, and the funny performances by Alan Cumming and Jamie Kennedy seem to make this movie worth wild. The story starts out with Tim Avery, an out of luck cartoonist who can't seem to catch a break, his dog finds the mysterious mask, and Tim thinks it is a Halloween mask, but when he puts on the mask. He becomes the life of the party, When he gets home, he then makes love to his wife, while still wearing the mask. The couple soon realize there gonna have a baby. And when the baby is born, the baby seems to possess incredible super powers. During this time, a mysterious god of mischief named Loki, is trailing the mask. Call me insane, but I like this movie.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Series note: As this is not a direct, chapter-like continuation of The Mask (1994), one can easily watch either film first.<br/><br/>If I ever needed proof that I'm looking for something different in a film than most folks, here it is. While I don't think Son of the Mask is flawless, the only flaw I can really see is that the flow of the story doesn't quite make it as enrapturing or emotionally impactful as, say, Schindler's List (1993) or The Shawshank Redemption (1994). Two factors mitigate that lack. One, Son of the Mask isn't shooting for the same compelling emotional intensity as a film like Schindler's List. Two, Son of the Mask's other outstanding artistic qualities enable it to largely transcend any problems it has with achieving a spellbinding plot.<br/><br/>Of course, related to point one above, it's not that every film needs to have a paradigm-shattering plot to succeed. The Godfrey Reggio/Philip Glass trilogy of Koyaanisqatsi (1983), Powaqqatsi (1988) and Naqoyqatsi (2002) all receive scores of 9 or 10 from me, and debatably they have no plots, even if they make many cogent, often philosophical, \"arguments\" about culture.<br/><br/>But it's not that Son of the Mask's story isn't good. The plot is set in the same location--the fictional Edge City--as the first Mask (as well as John Arcudi and Doug Mahnke's comic books, upon which both films are based). The story could take place either before or after the beloved Jim Carrey film. Tim Avery (Jamie Kennedy) lives in the bucolic countryside that's ironically only two miles outside of Edge City (it seems almost like a northeastern New Jersey, Westchester County or southwestern Connecticut joke). The mask of Loki, the \"God of mischief\" in Norse mythology, comes floating down a stream, to be found by Tim's dog, Otis (in an alliterative reference to Odin, Loki's father, and a pun on Milo and Otis). Tim puts it on just in time for a Halloween party, which enables him to get in the good graces of both his boss, played by comedian Steven Wright, and his wife, Tonya (Traylor Howard). Prior to this, Tim was having trouble at work as a struggling animator relegated to giving studio tours dressed up as a giant tortoise, and his wife was nagging him about having a baby.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, we get to meet Loki himself (played by Alan Cumming) in a fabulous prologue set in a museum. It seems that he's lost his mask (of course) and Odin (an almost unrecognizable Bob Hoskins) is nagging him to find it. Tim's masked persona enables him to get a promotion and procreate, but the baby just may metaphysically be the son of Loki, and Loki exploits this fact to try to find his mask.<br/><br/>Although it sounds complex, perhaps, that's a more than attractive story to me. It actually trumps the first Mask film in a way by bringing the source of the mask into the proceedings. It's highly fantastical and surreal, and it enables a great number of deeper themes and subtexts. To a large extent, Son of the Mask is a film about fatherhood. It explores the fears and foibles that many fathers and fathers-to-be experience. The resolution to the film's dilemmas--and director Lawrence Guterman adeptly maintains two primary dilemmas throughout--hinge on learning how to be a better father. But there are other important themes and subtexts, including the importance of personal assertiveness (carried over from the themes of the first film), the quandaries of dual career families, \"sibling\" rivalry, child development issues, and maybe even the beginnings of an Oedipal complex.<br/><br/>Not that this is primarily a serious film, but it's not meant to be only or primarily a laugh-out-loud comedy, either. Guterman is much more concerned with achieving a thoroughgoing surrealism than he is with trying to make you laugh. I love surrealism, so I'm a prime candidate to love this film. In fact, I can't imagine anyone with a taste for surrealism not appreciating the film, at least to an extent.<br/><br/>The production design--including things like the sets, matte paintings, costumes, and the ubiquitous cgi--is simply amazing. The surreal action sequences are even better. Perhaps even more than the first film, Son of the Mask realizes a \"live action\" cartoon.<br/><br/>Tex Avery is again a strong reference (made obvious by Kennedy's character being named \"Tim Avery\" and working as an animator), as is classic Warner Brothers animation in general. A long section in the middle is a clever spoof on Chuck Jones' One Froggy Evening (1955), and there is another long section that is straight out of the Roadrunner cartoons (involving Otis first drawing up blueprints then trying to execute an elaborate, almost Rube Goldbergian \"elimination contraption\").<br/><br/>The funniest aspect of the movie for me, perhaps, was a kind of \"suspended absurdity\", made most clear when Tonya returns from her business trip and finds her home (which was subtly modeled after cartoon homes circa the 1940s and 1950s) still in shambles from the cartoonish events that preceded--the piano is still hanging from the top of the stairs, the giant boxing glove is still engaged, and so on.<br/><br/>But the performers have many funny moments, too. Although Kennedy has a couple moments of Jim Carrey-like mannerisms when Tim is The Mask, and these underscore that Kennedy can't do Carrey like Carrey can (of course), these are few and far between. Kennedy is Tim as Tim for most of the film, and funny at that. Alan Cumming was hilarious in his different disguises when he's searching for his mask, and entertaining otherwise--he's impressed me in all of his films I've seen. I also found the baby frequently funny, especially when more surreal.<br/><br/>Giving Son of the Mask a 1 or 2 seems simply ridiculous to me, even if there are elements of the film you strongly dislike. Technically, at least, this is an exemplary work of art. It deserves to be reconsidered.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">For the record this is the story of the mask which was created by Loki, who after many centuries tries to find it again, only to have it fall into the hands of an animator and his infant son.<br/><br/>This film raises several interesting questions, first and foremost is why is Jaime Kennedy a star when he has no talent what so ever? Based on this film he is talentless \"actor\" with no charisma. It maybe the film, but he's so uninteresting as to make watching this a chore. I'm certain that Alan Cumming, Bob Hoskins and Steven Wright were doing this for a pay check, but at least they turned in something approximating a performance. Kennedy walks through this film like a slacker...<br/><br/>Then again considering the way the film turned out I'm convinced that most of the production staff were slackers.<br/><br/>The special effects aren't special. For a \"big budget\" Hollywood film the effects feel unfinished and video game like. They do not approximate real, even cartoon real. Its as if the producers decided that they had reached the level of the dancing baby and to them that was fine. Its awful.<br/><br/>The direction is poor. It has no comic sense. The wacky mask sequences fall flat. Whats worse is that they can't even approximate the classic Looney Tunes/MGM cartoons they copy.<br/><br/>What annoys me is that this isn't so bad its good, its just bad.<br/><br/>While this is certainly to be on my list of worst films of 2005, I can't give it the one out of ten it deserves, watching this I had the feeling that had this been better cast and directed this film might have actually worked. For the promise of what might have been I give this a two, however understand thats no reason to watch this waste of celluloid, this is a film best dropped in a very deep well for all eternity.</div>\n",

Let's take a film that was wildly successful and make a sequel out of it!<br/><br/>\"Perfect! We'll get B-grade actors who have half the charisma and want only 10% of Carrey's original salary. We'll save millions and rake in a massive profit, never mind the fact nobody wants to see a second rate sequel with none of the original actors that made it popular in the first place! We as executives still honestly believe a movie was popular based on the name and story, not the actors who made it so in the first place!\" <br/><br/>\"Brilliant! Let's put a massive budget and get the cheapest actors we can find!\" <br/><br/>And really, that's what Son Of The Mask can be described as. Just a simple B-grade movie that attempts to suck the life out of it's original classic.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, if the movie didn't contain the words the mask, or anything to do with the mask, it would be a nice kids movie. For all it's massive flaws and horrible acting, this really will appeal to kids. It's a good natured flick that really wants to scream out \"like me!\" but only those 8 and younger will truly enjoy it.<br/><br/>Jamie Kennedy is the only worthwhile mention in this movie. He clearly is trying to make the material work, playing the desperate dad but the script is so poor, the only thing that spews out that is worthwhile was my drink after seeing this. The character of Loki also deserves a mention, as he was the most enjoyable character and really one of the only reasons for older adults to see this film. It's too bad the character is wasted on this film, I would have really liked to have seen the character take on the true mask. Instead, we are reduced to fart jokes and toilet humor near the end.<br/><br/>The plot is so much by the books, I won't bother to mention it here. It's all so clearly obvious that even a Disney exec would be green with envy.<br/><br/>Save your money, this one is heading to DVD in three months from the looks of it. Shame on the studios for once again smearing a decent film with a horrible sequel. Didn't dumb and dumberer teach them anything?</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">First of all, like a bunch of other people, I loved the original Mask film with Jim Carrey. It was funny, it was cheeky, it was risqué, and it was entertaining overall.<br/><br/>An then over a decade later, this trainwreck comes to our screens. Literally the only returning cast member from the film is Ben Stein (the therapist from the last film; the teacher from Ferris Bueller's Day Off). Apart from him, there's no Jim Carrey, no Cameron Diaz, no Richard Jeni (.....oh wait), so most of the appeal of the first film was immediately thrown out the window.<br/><br/>Instead we're introduced to Jamie Kennedy, who is a whiny manchild who works in an animation studio, who comes across the mask picked up by his dog (presumably a different Jack Russell Terrier, RIP Milo) He wears the mask and impregnates his girlfriend/wife, apparently giving his child mask powers? It's ridiculous.<br/><br/>So Odin and Loki get involved (nope, not from the MCU because that would be awesome) and try to eliminate the child.<br/><br/>The child is eventually born, the dog gets jealous and tries to kill it, and Loki goes around creepily as well. OK, apart from some of these scenes having the most horrific and poorly handled CGI I've ever seen, this film really has a problem with which audience it's catering to. The characters are too exaggerated, the visuals are legitimately traumatizing, so the kids won't enjoy it. And the same thing will apply for adults because the acting is horrendous, Jamie Kennedy is a horrible replacement for Jim Carrey, and the script may as well have been written by a six-year-old. Plot holes and red herrings dominate the story, with there literally being no rhyme or reason for this film for existing.<br/><br/>This film is desperate to extract any reaction from its audience, and this includes reactions of trauma, horror, anger, boredom and frustration. Avoid this film like the plague.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">This a special effects-driven comedy based on Dark Horse comic books series. It deals about an aspirant cartoonist(Jamie Kennedy), named Tim Avery(homage to Tex Avery)is living with his fiancée and dog Otis. But appear in his life a newborn baby with Mask's sensational powers. Meanwhile in Valhalla, the mythological Odin(Bob Hoskins) is infuriate at his son Loki(Alan Cumming) for losing the magical mask and orders look it for and he's willing to get whatever cost. Then, the powerful baby with godlike faculties confronting Loki in an extraordinary taking on.<br/><br/>This is a rip-roaring sequel from Jim Carrey's successful film. It packs exaggerated humor, frenetic action, excessive jokes, noisy comedy with some nice moments here and there. Pitched at hectic pace, lots of cartoonist special effects,Tex Avery-alike, and with ominous angle camera to create genuine area of apprehension. The film is studded with funny scenes but also some embarrassing. The movie is a vehicle for Jamie Kennedy,the baby and the dog , their rubber faces are an incredible asset magnified by the breathtaking FX, courtesy of Industrial light Magic. Colorful cinematography by Gardiner and lively musical score by Randy Edelman(Last of Mohican,Gettysburg). The film is regularly directed by Laurence Guterman(Cat and dogs), providing a megablast of mayhem with the occasional original touch, even if its whole central set-up fails to convince. Rating : Average though with some entertaining moment.</div>\n",

Ten years after the original, we meet Tim Avery and his sexy wife, Tonya. (Jamie Kennedy does an awesome job as Tim. He's always hilarious!) Their dog, Otis finds the mask and brings it to him. At a HALLOWEEN party, Tim puts the mask on, and becomes just as zany as Stanley had. After the party, he goes home and makes sweet love to his wife with the mask on. Nine months later, little Alvey is born and has the powers of the mask. Loki, the god of mischief is looking for the mask and the baby. When Tonya leaves town, Tim has to care for Alvey, but Alvey is trying to drive him crazy. Finally, Alvey begins to like his dad. Loki finds both the mask and Alvey and holds Alvey hostage. Tim needs the mask to help stop Loki. Tonya comes back and doesn't believe whats happening. Tim and Loki use their powers to stop each other. When it comes to making Alvey pick who he wants to go with, Tim doesn't need the mask to show how much he loves him. If you love comedy, and the original, you might like SON OF THE MASK!!!!</div>\n",

Tonya would love to start a family but Tim wants to first make it big, as a cartoonist, for the animation company he works for. Get ready for a turn of events. The couple's darling dog brings home THE mask, the one Jim Carrey wore in the first film and Tim falls under its spell for an evening. Not only does he score big points at a company party for his cartoon ideas, he also scores when he gets home. Tonya is delighted when she becomes pregnant. However, when their son Alvey is born, he has mask-like powers from time to time. This is known only to Tim and the Norse God Thor and his son, Loki. Seems Thor wants the mask out of human hands and orders Loki to find it and the magical child. Let the games begin. This is not really horrible entertainment, as one may have heard or expect. The plot zips along nicely and the performers do their jobs well, especially Alan Cumming as Loki. The art direction and special effects are the true highlights, however. The film sports vibrant colors everywhere and the effects are truly amazing. Watch Loki change identities, each one adorable, or watch the baby swing his father, Tim, around when he feels like it. And much more, including a big ending at the car garage. If you liked the first film, you will miss Carrey, no doubt about it. But, give this one a chance. It qualifies definitely as entertainment rather than art, which is not always an unwelcome thing. Smiles will abound at any showing.</div>\n",

The main reason why I downloaded this movie and the original movie was because I remembered watching this one from my childhood days and I just wanted to have a trip back down memory lane. I just can't believe how low the rating was for this movie.<br/><br/>This film made me laugh. I did find the baby creepy (even when I was a child), but hell, it was still funny. If I would compare the first movie and this one, I wouldn't be able to choose. The first film gave me a sort of Who Framed Roger Rabbit vibe. This film just had F-U-N all over it! I can't completely pick one film over the other, since I liked some parts in the first film (when Jim Carrey wasn't the Mask) and I also liked some parts in the second film (the humor!). Very difficult for me to choose.<br/><br/>This film isn't perfect, but it doesn't deserve such a low rating. I've seen films worse than these! This movie was made for enjoyment purposes and it seems that some people have overlooked that fact.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">The most fun since Roger Rabbit. This movie had a good blend of action, comedy and animation. It just feels like you are glued to your seat. The story begins with the Avery family when the husband gets a hold of the magical mask, when he puts it on a party he becomes live and animated. When he and his wife discover they are going to have a baby,and when the baby is born the baby starts developing his own possessive power but then Loki who is known as a god of mischief comes into this world seeking the mask and he will stop at nothing to get the mask back. It was a great that kept your mind occupied. Do you think that the Avery family can make it Stay tuned to find out.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Whoever thought that a sequel to the smash Jim Carrey film The Mask was a good idea should be shot, this was the failed attempt to do it, from Razzie nominated Lawrence Guterman (Cats &amp; Dogs). Basically, ten years after previous events, the Mask has floated down river from the sea of Edge City, and found its way in the hands of aspiring cartoon animator Tim Avery (Razzie nominated Jamie Kennedy). Tim finds out the special powers of the Mask, and goes for a wild Halloween night out with his company, and next morning, Tim's wife Tonya (Traylor Howard), desperate for a baby, finds out she is pregnant. Meanwhile Loki (Razzie nominated Alan Cumming), the God of mischief, has been sent to Earth by his infuriated father Odin (Razzie nominated Bob Hoskins) to retrieve the Mask. When Tim's baby Alvey (twins Liam and Ryan Falconer) is born, he slowly realises that he didn't technically father his child, he did it while wearing the Mask, which explains the baby's extraordinary powers. Dog Otis feels unloved by his owners, and when he puts the Mask on he really gets to express how much he wants the baby out the way, but Alvey is getting the better of him. When Loki eventually finds Tim and the Mask, through Alvey, he makes a deal to give the baby back when he meets him at a certain place, and he becomes attached. In the end, Tim, with the Mask on again, and Loki ask Alvey choose who he really wants to be with, and it is when Tim takes the Mask off that the baby makes the right decision, and Loki and father Odin make up. Also starring The Mask's Ben Stein as Dr. Neuman, Steven Wright as Daniel Moss and Peter Flett as Mr. Kemperbee. The special effects I suppose are alright, but the casting is atrocious, the story played out is ridiculous, and it has nowhere near the same inventiveness and humour as the original. It is filled with just too many gross and over-the-top wild moments, and it just looks and feels really cheap, an absolutely awful fantasy comedy sequel. Poor!</div>\n",

It was cool and overcast and rain was predicted. I didn't want to go to a park... and after lunch, when I mentioned \"Superbabies,\" the deal was struck!<br/><br/>Background: My grandson fell in love with superheroes this year, and he has been alternately garbed as Spiderman and Superman, as well as a pirate complete with eye patch and skull-and-crossbones hat. His favorite possession is his plastic sword! Yesterday, going to the movie, he asked me if I could get him a parrot to sit on his shoulder! <br/><br/>He loved the movie and gave it two \"thumbs up\" (both his)! So, if you have an almost four-year-old, it might work for you. Otherwise, forget it. I paid $10.50 for both of us (one senior and one child) and slept through this movie.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">I was expecting this movie to be bad, and it was even worse than I expected. I have seen some truly terrible movies in my time like Home Alone 4, NeverEnding Story 3 and any of the Friedburg-Seltzer movies. But Superbabies:Baby Geniuses 2 brings the phrase \"terrible movie\" to a new level. And believe me, that is being kind about this piece of garbage. I am truly not surprised that it is in the bottom 100, it deserves to be there. That is how bad it is, and it highly deserved the 4 Razzie nominations it received. If you thought the first movie was bad, and it was, this is even worse. Sorry if I sound harsh, but I am trying to be honest.<br/><br/>The dialogue was absolutely excruciating. I seriously wouldn't be surprised if it was written by a six year old. It completely lacked sophistication and humour. And guess how many times I laughed during this movie? You guessed right, not even once! The plot was lazy, uninspired and clumsy. The idea of a media mogul wanting to dominate the world? How many times has this being done before? Loads, and much better might I add. The direction was sluggish and never reached its focus. Even worse than the dialogue, direction and plot were the fight sequences. How tedious were they? Very, not to mention very inappropriate, even for a family movie.<br/><br/>The performances from the entire cast were exceedingly poor. Jon Voight has pulled off some good performances in the past. However, I truly think he was held at gunpoint to star in this mess. And he gives the worst performance of his entire career here, acquiring a simply dreadful German accent that has to be among the worst ever accents in film history. It was worse than his accent in Anaconda, honestly there were times when I couldn't understand what he was saying. The other performers weren't that much better either, Scott Baio especially was wasted. And the child performers were misguided, they just couldn't do anything with the script. And I do apologise here, but I don't think babies trying to behave like adults is cute or funny in the slightest.<br/><br/>Even the camera work was next to abysmal, nothing more than flat and rushed. Shame really, because there was one or two nice bits of scenery. In fact, the only real half decent element of this this otherwise abysmal film was the music, and even that was forgettable at best. All in all, Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2 was nothing more than a piece of garbage, that was the low point of Jon Voight's acting career. 0/10 Bethany Cox</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">If you've been thinking about hiring somebody to clean out those clogged gutters or to get that darned septic tank working again, just call Jon Voight. Yeah, the same Jon Voight who won an Academy Award as best actor in 1978 for \"Coming Home.\" The star of \"Midnight Cowboy,\" \"Catch-22\" and \"Conrack\" -- you know, Angelina Jolie's dad.<br/><br/>Why bother Mr. Voight? Well, considering that he's lending his name to \"SuperBabies: Baby Geniuses 2,\" he clearly has a lot of time on his hands, doesn't consider any job too demeaning and probably won't charge too much.<br/><br/>In case you're wondering why Voight would elect to appear in \"SuperBabies,\" the follow-up to a movie he wasn't in, instead of \"Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid\" -- and don't pretend you don't remember the scene in the first \"Anaconda\" in which the gargantuan serpent swallows, then coughs up Voight -- here's a hint: Voight was an executive producer of the original \"Baby Geniuses.\" Since that 1999 fiasco effectively torpedoed what was left of the screen careers of Christopher Lloyd and Kathleen Turner, it must have been a formidable challenge finding actors eager to strip themselves of every scintilla of dignity to perform alongside a bunch of feisty computer-generated toddlers (with the exception of Scott Baio and Vanessa Angel, of course). Apparently for Voight it was put up or shut up time.<br/><br/>So here he is, ladies and gentlemen, outfitted with not one, but two dollar-store-quality wigs and employing an absurd German accent as Bill Biscane, a megalomaniac who plans to use cheaply made, insipid kiddie TV shows to hypnotize babies around the world and rob them of their free will; clearly, Biscane marches to the sound of his own drummer. But those who cherish the ideal of infants being able to make their own choices need not despair: SuperBaby Kahuna (played by Gerry, Leo and Myles Fitzgerald, who are by no means identical triplets) is on the case, and if there's anybody you want on your side when you're facing an onslaught of wretched programming, it's \"a small fry with a big attitude\" who taunts his enemies with such put-downs as \"Why don't you pick on somebody half your size?\" and \"Never send a man to do a boy's job.\"<br/><br/>Kahuna -- who is revealed to be a grown man trapped in the body of a pre-schooler, in a slightly sickening plot twist that requires three flashback scenes to post-World War II Germany to explain -- has some major connections, too. He can jump on his computer network and converse with Whoopi Goldberg, the members of that nearly forgotten boy-band O-Town, or any other celebrity or pseudo-celebrity willing to be pasted into a movie that only an unfortunate few are fated to see. Although he seems wise beyond his years as he notes that \"every child has power -- all you have to do is believe,\" Kahuna lives in what looks like a papier-mache cave full of large plywood and plaster imitation toys that might have been salvaged from the windows of a now-defunct F.A.O. Schwarz location. It's a sad sight indeed.<br/><br/>There are other four SuperBabies, too, and just prior to the climactic showdown with Biscane and his goons, this diaper-clad quartet jumps onto Kahuna's magic carousel, where they are transformed into Brain Boy (who wears a scaled-down cap and gown), Cupid Girl (who shoots arrows that cause grown men to stop fighting and hug each other instead), Bounce Baby (who is stuck inside an orange beach ball) and Baby Courageous (whose get-up proves that the only thing that looks worse than a grown man in a tacky hairpiece is a toddler in a bad toupee).<br/><br/>Watching from the sidelines are Baio and Angel, as the dizzy owners of a highly questionable day care center in which most of the children parade around half-dressed, and Hilary Duff clone Skyler Shaye and Frankie Muniz lookalike Justin Chatwin, who attempt to provide a bit of squeaky-clean teen love interest -- not exactly what the target audience of 6-year-olds is itching to see.<br/><br/>As was the case with \"Baby Geniuses,\" the movie contains a surplus of awkward-looking digital effects that are supposed to convince us the wee ones are actually making wisecracks and running wild. The results are generally pitiful. If \"SuperBabies\" is marginally better than the excruciating \"Geniuses\" -- and you sure wouldn't want to live on the difference -- it's because director Bob Clark and screenwriter Gregory Poppen don't shoehorn in nearly as much innuendo or smarminess this time around; they're equally stingy with charm and imagination as well.<br/><br/>By the way, Voight's next project is called \"The Karate Dog,\" in which he'll co-star with Simon Rex, Pat Morita and Chevy Chase, who'll provide \"the voice of Cho-Cho,\" according to the Internet Movie Database. Do an Oscar winner a big favor and call him this weekend -- really, the guy must be willing to do just about anything for a couple bucks.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"content\">\n",
      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Okay, the first movie from this series \"Baby Geniuses\" was so poorly received that reviewers were beside themselves castigating the film. It currently is ranked #73 on the IMDb Bottom 100 list. Yet, astoundingly, the film led to this even worse sequel--\"Baby Geniuses 2\"! This sort of sequel is a prime example how some people in Hollywood just need to get real jobs...or at least stop doing LSD! Unlike the first horrible piece of garbage that is \"Baby Geniuses\", this film manages to be significantly worse for several important reasons: <br/><br/>1. It is totally unoriginal. While \"Baby Geniuses\" was dumb, it was somewhat original and perhaps the film makers naively thought the film would sell. Here, however, they knew they were producing a giant stinky diaper of a film from the onset--following the horrible drubbing the first film received--and yet they STILL made it!<br/><br/>2. \"Baby Geniuses 2\" has some of the absolute worst computer work I've seen in a recent film. The babies are horribly dubbed as their computer generated lip movements didn't match--and in some cases looked really creepy.<br/><br/>3. Jon Voight managed to do a much, much worse job as the villain compared to the combined talents of Christopher Lloyd and Kathleen Turner in the original. That took LOTS of effort! Lots and lots and lots of effort!<br/><br/>4. A ninja baby! While one of the babies in the original film did some karate here and there, here we have an honest-to-goodness ninja baby--complete with ninja mask and insanely ridiculous wire-fu stunts.<br/><br/>5. Two words about the second film that say it all...SCOTT BAIO! <br/><br/>6. Even more pop culture references that no child would understand. Considering that 99.9% of the people who actually wanted to see the film were children, this is a serious problem.<br/><br/>7. The @&amp;*$ kids talk and talk and make commentary on EVERYTHING. It's like going to a movie with an annoying kid sitting next to you who thinks he's the host of Mystery Science Theater 3000 and talks throughout--but in reality, he is just an obnoxious child who won't shut up. PLEASE shut up!!! SHUT UP!!!! SHUT UP!!!!!!! <br/><br/>8. Gadgets! Unlike the first film, this one gives the ninja kid all kinds of super gadgets, such as a car like the Batmobile that spouts flames out the back, a James Bond-like mini-copter and Dick Tracy communication devices.<br/><br/>9. The ninja baby has his own version of the Bat Cave--complete with holograms and Willie Wonka-like accessories.<br/><br/>10. In many ways, \"Baby Geniuses 2\" is like the first film merged with \"Spy Kids 2\"--another bad kids film. It manages to combine the worst qualities of each! <br/><br/>11. The ninja kid is a Buddhist with super-powers. As a result, now nearly 1 billion Buddhists worldwide also hate this film. Instead of offending this religion, they should have attacked a fringe cult like the Movementarians.<br/><br/>12. A romance between two teenagers that just seemed a bit creepy. Seeing two teens kiss who look a lot younger than their actual age made me feel a bit queasy. My 19 year-old said she felt the same.<br/><br/>13. For the cost of \"Baby Geniuses 2\", they could have funded ten independent films...or more. While this isn't a huge budget film, it cost a lot of money for the special effects. What a sad waste.<br/><br/>14. Towards the end of the film, several babies sprout super-powers. One is like Superman and can fly, one shoots magic arrows, one is a giant bouncy ball (how that can come in handy against the villains is anyone's guess) and one is \"Brain Boy\" (whatever that means).<br/><br/>15. The last 10 minutes...oh, does it suck! No, it Mega-sucks! <br/><br/>16. The end of the film rips off Bogie from \"Casablanca\"--what sorry sacrilege.<br/><br/>Overall, this is truly a horrible film. While there might be films that look crappier or have worse production values, the fact that this one DOES have a decent budget and production values yet is this thoroughly horrible makes this an amazing film. Clearly, it deserves to be on IMDb's infamous list! At one point, one of the babies make a comment that would be the perfect description of this sequel--\"Oh no, I'm feeling nauseous again\".</div>\n",

It's meant to make the young ones laugh and the adults cringe In embarrassment! I find It rather sad that so many adults have so many bad things to say about a film so obviously not Intended for them! Why would a story about super-toddlers be aimed at a target audience above 13 anyway? This movie Is a laugh and a bit of imagination fun for the little-ones and It does It's job - the sets and effects are poor because they don't need to be any better and after all the whole thing Is pretty tongue-In-cheek! Super-hero kids take on the bad guys - what more can pre-teens ask for? The kids liked It and that's what counts!</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">It is difficult to review a movie this bad where does one start ? The dreadful screenplay. Does this studio employ script readers. The horrible characters Jon Voight as a Neo-Nazi is one step away from doing xxx porn. A steep decline for an actor who once received an Academy Award(Coming Home) At the screening I attended no less than 12,of the families attending walked out a third of the way through leaving 5, brave families in the theatre .And there was no laughter even from the kids . This film has studio tax write-off written all over it. Why it wasn't sent direct to video is a mystery for the ages. Some studio exec actually thought this would make money ?!?!!!! The animated baby talking is horribly done; the mouth movements never match the actual words . It is said you can learn just as much from a bad movie as a good one. The only thing I learned here is that Hollywood has been taken far astray from its roots . Whoever gave this dirty diaper the green light should be fired or made to watch this over and over and over ........</div>\n",

The first 'Baby Geniuses' made like five cents in its entire run this one will be lucky to clear half of that .

Plus, all the babies in the film speak like they are in an educational T.V. show, and the storyline is, somewhat, fair. But what I did not like was, too much time in baby world, lack of character introductory, the four babies in-film are supposedly supporting roles, due to them being sidekicks of Kahuna. The humor is, indeed, lacked, and Bob Clark chose a poor movie to direct, although his final, because it is now one of the worst films of all time.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">The first \"Baby Geniuses\" movie was inane and boring enough, why make a sequel? Are studios that hard up to make money? That scared of trying something different for fear of losing money? I guess they figure going with a franchise that has a proved record of mediocrity is safer - at least you're not surprised when you lose money. This film is not campy or cheesy bad, it's just plain boring bad - the worst kind of cinematic experience.<br/><br/>I guess my reason for writing a review of a movie this bad several years after its release is this - Parents, if you're looking for family-safe entertainment, you can do better than this type of film. Your kids are smarter than this. If they're young enough not to mind sitting through this film, then they are too young to enjoy any kind of movie anyways. For family-safe entertainment you can never go wrong with just about anything made by Pixar. Pixar knows how to make films that use CGI to accentuate already good plots and interesting characters, not as a substitute for them.<br/><br/>As for this film, it makes Gigli look like Citizen Kane. 20 years from now if there is a \"Mystery Science 4000\" to replace the now defunct MST3K, I'm sure this film will be one of the featured objects of ridicule... if the poor robots can stand the torment of sitting through it.</div>\n",

But what unfolded was truly a bomb - neither funny nor coherent. Thank goodness these don't come along that often.<br/><br/>Other than a flatulence joke in the first 5 minutes of the film (now a requirement for children's cinema), the laughs were few and far between in the remaining 90 minutes of this movie. During the many long periods of boredom, many questions began racing through my head. Why are these babies talking? Why do we care? Why aren't they saying anything funny?<br/><br/>I can only assume that Jon Voight has a grandchild/godchild/nephew/niece, for whom he dedicated this performance. There really could be no other plausible reason for such an actor to associate with something with so little merit.</div>\n",

There is a woman with very large lips (Vanessa Angel) who almost makes it bearable, just for the pure fascination of watching whether or not they will explode.

The first movie stunk like government cheese so it should be of no surprise that this sequel stinks. The so-called plot revolves around some evil media mogul named Biscane(played by Jon Voight)with some wacky scheme revolving around mind control on kids through the TV screen. The baby \"geniuses headed by Kahuna plan to take on Biscane and cheesy hijinks ensue. The plot is horrible and the acting is just as bad. Scott Baio should have bowed out gracefully since Charles In Charge went off the air but no he chose to be here. Jon Voight usually shines even when he is in a bad movie but here he hams it up like its going out of style. Plus Jon Voight being in this movie shows you how far some actors are willing to go for a pay check. I mean doesn't he and Christopher Walken have enough pride to not star in the trash films they starred in? The jokes are why-did-the-chicken-cross-the-road corny but it seems that the director believes that a crappy jokes are funny when it comes from toddlers. WRONG! Crappy jokes are still crappy jokes even if it comes from children. What kind of milk you drinkin? Who wrote this script? the writers of Howard The Duck? If you like this movie you are the moronic target audience. This movie is bad enough to make a kid cry and as a matter of fact, I let my niece watch it and she was bored to tears. No, I'm not being mean-spirited, this movie is not even so bad its good. Its so bad its terrible. Only a shill could recommend this atrocity to celluloid. Jon Voight should fire his agent and Scott Baio should quit while people still have fond memories of him. Two Thumbs WAAAAAYYYYYYY down!</div>\n",

Get pretty toasted and kind of forget to come home straight after the concert. Sure I went to an after party, but only to call a cab which didn't show up for over an hour. It was not pretty at home today.  My punishment- take my 5 year old daughter to see this dreck.<br/><br/>\n",
      " Bob Clark is almost in the Ed Wood category with his body of work. Although, I must admit I really liked \"A Christmas Story\".  But this film was truly one of the worst films I've ever sat through.  What was Jon Voight thinking when he accepted this role.  Surely it couldn't have been purely financial.  The guy has had a lot of paydays over the years.  <br/><br/>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Terrible. That's just one word that could describe this pile of diaper entertainment. Another movie is unwatchable. I had to sit through this garbage while watching some kids one day, and I knew this movie wasn't good when even the kids lost interest a few minutes in. There are movies where the kids get into the action, they cheer on the good guys, or they involve themselves into the movie. Not this one. Superbabies entertained none of the kids, and left me wondering how this movie ever left the boardroom where the script was written. The movie did solve one question that had been burning inside of me for a while: Where has Scott Baio been? Here, he plays a father of one of the babies and director of a new daycare center that may or may not be integral in the plot to take over the world by the diabolical Biscane (Jon Voight). I can understand Baio being in this movie, he hasn't really been in demand of late. But when I see Voight perform in this movie, I wonder to myself \"Why?\" He's done some good work of late, notably in Holes and National Treasure, and then he plays some sort of super villain with a bad German accent who is derailed by 2 year-olds. He'll bounce back, he has to. The babies in the movie, who are supposed to be the stars, looks freaky to me. The voices do not sync up with the movie lips at all. I think the characters in South Park have better synchronization than these babies. And the movie is not funny either. Again, I go to the kids, where I noticed none of them laughed at all. Instead, they all wanted to read, or draw, or take a nap, or do their laundry. Anything to escape this movie.</div>\n",

Contrary to the numerous unfair comments made by critics,this movie is interesting and highly recommended for kids.<br/><br/>Plot of Super babies:<br/><br/>Following on from the plot of the last movie, four babies can communicate with each other using 'baby talk', and have knowledge of many secrets. The baby geniuses become involved in a scheme by media mogul Bill Biscane (Jon Voight), later revealed to be known as Kane, who kidnaps children everywhere. Helping the geniuses is a legendary superbaby named Kahuna (he became powerful due to drinking a special chemical, much to the envy of his brother Kane), who stops Biscane's plots and saves children from being kidnapped by Biscane and his minions. He joins up with several other babies in an attempt to stop Biscane, who intends to use a state-of-the-art satellite system to control the world's population by brainwashing them and forcing people to not be active and watch TV the rest of their lives.<br/><br/>Rent or buy This DVD!. This lovely movie is especially made for kids.</div>\n",

I suggest IMDb add zero to the rating system for seriously unwatchable movies such as this one.<br/><br/>Superbabies has made a thing of filming some toddlers, then adding poorly synced voice-over to make them \"talk\". Turns out, this is not inherently funny, in fact, it's mostly annoying. To not just make a movie about a couple of babies having a nonsense conversation, they make the toddlers do things, by the use of some pretty lackluster special effects, not bad enough to be funny and not good enough to be believable, just bad. <br/><br/>And what do the film makers do with these walking, talking babies? They have them be the main characters of the most annoyingly anti-funny, excruciatingly inane action comedy I have ever seen. Example 1: The \"evil henchmen\" (my heroes) have cornered the main character, but instead of shooting him (and ending the movie early), they engage him in stupid comedy fist fight. Example 2: When the \"good guys\" (the villains in my book) manage to steel the CD of doom (or whatever) from the evil mastermind, they don't just destroy it (and end the movie), instead they have another \"comedy\" fight over it. Unfunny slapstick action starring babies, repeated in ad nauseum seems to be the recipe for this entire film.<br/><br/>I actually felt slightly sick while seeing this movie, I implore you, don't make the same mistake I did, see any other movie than this one, heck it could even be another movie off the bottom 100 list.</div>\n",

Scientists wanting to understand baby talk? Who could've possibly come up with such magnitude of greatness? Oh yeah, my idol: Bob Clark. Despite his shitty movie \"A Christmas Story\", he has got to be the best director of our generation. Kubrick literally has nothing on him. The casting is also fantastic: The 3 Fitzgerald brothers returned, thankfully. Their schedules are busy with cinema opportunities, we all know, but I'm so thankful that they could return. Please, if you have any free time, watch this movie. It's literally the best creation on Planet Earth. I've never seen anything like this masterpiece. Please, do it for me.

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">A tough one to rate. It certainly has entertainment value, but it's frustrating that it could have been so much better. On the one hand, the concept of bringing villains and other Spidermen in from alternate universes is fantastic, and it was great to see some of these characters again. There is so much star power in the cast here, and the special effects are wonderful.<br/><br/>On the other hand, there is quite a bit of bloat as well. I'm all for character development and non-action scenes in action movies, but too often these moments were poorly written and bogged the film down. I have to say, I didn't care for how naïve Tom Holland's version of Spider-Man was either, and I could never buy in to the concept that he would try to \"fix\" the villains before sending them back to their own universes. This seemed asinine to me, and how that would stop them from dying where they came from was a mystery too. There are several other plot elements that are either weakly crafted (Dr. Strange getting trapped by some quick Spidey-math) or boring (Peter Parker and his friends and their college admission drama, good grief). Give me more of the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe), less of Ned Leeds, the goofy sidekick.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Spider-Man: No Way Home is a phenomenal conclusion to the trilogy and Holland's best outing as Spidey yet. Starts off fun, safe and familiar and then becomes extremely emotional, satisfying and full of great callbacks. A love letter to all things Spider-Man.<br/><br/>Tom Holland gives an incredible lead performance once again, reliably charming and likeable but with a lot more emotional heft this time around. Zendaya and Jacob Batalon both have perfect chemistry with Holland and are also incredible in their own ways.<br/><br/>Benedict Cumberbatch reaffirms why he's such a good Doctor Strange with his excellent dry wit and gravitas. All the returning villains give strong performances but Willem Dafoe is definitely the standout performance with an unsettling and terrifying presence.<br/><br/>Jon Watts' direction is superb, the action sequences are thrillingly acrobatic once again but refreshingly impactful this time around. There's a few homages to the styles of the previous iterations and some gorgeous imagery.<br/><br/>It's also perfectly paced with none of its roughly 2hr 30 minute runtime feeling dull or overly long due to a strong momentum established early on. The CG is extremely impressive with only a few weak spots.<br/><br/>The music by Michael Giacchino is fantastic, a nice balance of themes from the previous iterations and use of Holland's iconic motifs which are slightly altered in ways that work as well as a few new additions that are beautifully epic.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Awful movie. The plot sucked and had awful pacing humour, and dialogue were subpar(like the octopus joke). And they couldn't think of anything better so they brought back some old characters which still didn't save this poorly written film. One bad dialogue scene was when the 3 Spider-Men where making jokes about Tobey's organic webs which was just awkward and humorless. And to add to that, Tobey saying that \"my back\" joke and Norman Osborn repeating \"I'm something of a scientist myself\". Just why?! The film could never decide whether it's a comedy or a dark action movie.<br/><br/>This movie certifies that Tom Holland is the worst Spider-Man. With great power comes great responsibility and MCU Spider-Man lacks that. He's had 6 movies and still acts like an inexperienced, immature, not independent, not smart and acts like a rookie. And the whole plot started because he couldn't think of an alternative to get him and his friends to college so he got Doctor Strange to go and make a spell so that everyone will forget that Peter is Spider-Man(also doing it without his friends consent). And of course with Peter being the doofus he is, he messes up the spell which causes the multiverse to collide. There's a reason why his messes are always cleaned up by someone better than him. One of Spider-Man's best traits is his quick thinking and it was so inevitable that after messing up the spell, he decides to go and talk to the headteacher of the college for a placement(same scene where Doctor Octopus appears). You'd think he would have learnt his lesson about trusting villains in Far From Home but no; he does it again which caused Aunt May's death. It could have been avoided if he had just sent them home, but no they needed to be \"cured\"(which is odd because The Lizard was cured in the Amazing Spider-Man). It just made him look sappy and too Disney like, thinking he can change their fate. It's also not smart to invite dangerous villains into your house with a non superhero family member there. How could he trust them that quickly? When you see it, you find it hard to feel bad for Peter because you're like \"yeah this guy sucks\" The emotional scenes in this movie were pretty awful, especially how long and stretched May's death was and they still tried to exchange jokes and had her standing up right before dying(also re wording Uncle Ben's infamous line which sounded wrong). Family member deaths are always before the character becomes a hero so doing it after feels cheap. It wasn't even basic superhero bad luck, just Spider-Man not thinking straight.<br/><br/>Marvel really need new writers(especially in the comedic department), because they've released 4 bad movies this year and a TV show that messed up a timeline just like No Way Home did. And they've also ruined Spider-Man's character by not properly developing him and just throwing him into the Avengers drama. They are cash grabbers and only adding him because he is popular and it will get the movie ticket sales up. No Way Home is one of the few movies that make me wish the villains had won, and the reason is that the plot armour on Spider-Man was too strong. Like when geometry was somehow the answer to get out of the mirror dimension. Green Goblin was right about his morality getting the better of him.<br/><br/>Overall this movie was just an overhyped, over budgeted nostalgia bait and Spider-Man is the real antagonist of this film. Always puts people in danger for no reason.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">It's hard to discuss this movie and not get into the spoilers because the biggest moments of this movie necessitate ruining several of the big reveals. I loved that not everything was in the trailer and I successfully avoided reading too much about the film, which helped my enjoyment. This was the first movie I've seen in a theater since Halloween Kills, so the risk of COVID-19 and all its variants didn't keep me away* from the biggest movie of the year.<br/><br/>This movie arrives as so many older directors gatekeep what constitutes a movie. So let me break down my opinion: movies can be anything you want them to be. There is equal room for a high end Oscar contender as there is for the junk low end world that I live in, the places where Godfrey Ho, Jess Franco and Bruno Mattei make their home.<br/><br/>What else are comic book movies other than classical myths made with computers and no small amount of sound and fury? So yeah, this is the 27th Marvel Cinematic Universe movie and you know, you don't have to watch these movies. Hollywood -- the world -- is still making something for everyone. But for crowd-pleasing moments, the two biggest I've heard in years are when Captain America lifted Mjolnir and when one of the characters arrived in this film, a literally explosion of happiness and joy from an audience that has weathered so much in the last two years.<br/><br/>And isn't that why movies exist? To make us feel something?<br/><br/>No movie that I have seen in a theater in nearly a decade has elicited that emotional outburst and you know, it brought true joy to my heart. So I didn't feel silly expressing my emotions, whether they were happy when a certain legal professional made his presence known or the sadness of Dr. Strange's final words to Peter Parker.<br/><br/>Spider-Man has always lived by the lesson that with great power comes great responsibility. He's a character informed -- in every incarnation -- by a great loss that he was at fault for and a lifetime of making up for that mistake.<br/><br/>Yet Spider-Man: No Way Home presents us with something new. Great power with responsibility also means being better than your enemies and at times, working to make them better people and not just punching them into oblivion. The fact that antagonists can be worth saving spoke to me, someone usually given to mad revenge schemes and years of grudges. Even when doing the right thing ends up hurting you, you still can do the right thing.<br/><br/>These are big concepts for a comic book spectacle. And this movie does what all great films should. It's stuck in my mind since I saw it and I wanted some time away from it before I wrote this. Spider-Man is the story of a bully grown up and moving past the way he was treated, often finding those bullies -- Flash Thompson, Eddie Brock -- become if not friends, certainly no longer enemies.<br/><br/>This also gets into the Marvel idea of a multiverse, a connected web of other realities where small differences -- Disney+ set this up with What If...? And this idea will form the heart of Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness -- but the main part of this story remains refreshingly human in the midst of big ideas, strange science and concepts like how magic works.<br/><br/>Look -- I don't have to sell you on these movies. They make so much money that they're critic proof. But I do want you to consider that even if you hate superhero movies, even if you think there are too many of them, to consider your favorite film series. What if you had more than three of the original Star Wars films and they all were progressively better? What if the last Jason, Freddy or Hellraiser movie was so much better than the original? What if James Bond got more human, more relevant and more real as the world around him became even stranger?<br/><br/>That's what's happening here. And it's amazing.<br/><br/>*I'm triple vaxxed, beyond fastidious about mask wearing and personal space, and rarely if ever leave my movie basement. This isn't a political statement. Viruses don't have politics and if you think they do, you can kindly never read another word that I write.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Review By Kamal K<br/><br/>I don't think this film was written well. It had already established Spider-man characters with no involvement with Stark, but still failed at making Tom's Peter any better than he was when under Tony Stark's mentorship. This movie was not good. No amount of nostalgia saved it for me. It had pacing issues, for example the movie skimmed past Peter's whole identity exposed moment and chucked Daredevil in for a meaningless cameo as nobody seemed to truly care that as a blind man, he was able to catch a brick chucked through the window. He was literally just there for fanservice, and not a well written one. The rest of the movie is pointless as by the end, they just reverse everything by sending the spider-men and villains back to their world, after of course, seemingly retconning the plots of the previous spider-man movies by curing the villains, who were taken before they met their demise. Therefore their fights with spider-man end on a lame note as they all just become ordinary men towards the end of the original battles and so the Peter Parkers wouldn't experience the key character development and progression of their stories from this.<br/><br/>And in usual MCU fashion, the film is riddled with jokes that sometimes hit, but mostly fall flat. Awful humour, which is constantly blurted out after (or during) serious moments because the writers simply couldn't leave us without jokes for two whole minutes. Constant tonal shifts because of the \"jokes\", And the Peters just felt like they needed to be there for Tom's Peter? Bad writing at its finest.<br/><br/>Yes, this whole movie could've been avoided if Peter just listened to Doctor Strange, a man who actually knows magic and the consequences of messing spells up, but nope, he has to be stupid when he is supposed to be smart. Strange was literally the best character in the entire film, just for being the only one with a working braincell.<br/><br/>Overall, I found this movie quite bad. Nothing about it made me want to rewatch it and I have been feeling this with MCU movies recently like Black Widow and Shang chi, I will continue to watch Spider-man movies just because of my love for the character, but I will most likely continue to think the MCU's portrayal of the character is the worst even though Tom Holland's acting is great.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">This is a movie made purely to satisfy the fans and there should be no doubt about that. No Way Home, in my opinion, is even better than Homecoming and Far From Home, and pretty much one of the best MCU movies of all time. It's a simple story, but the execution is fantastic. Even the smallest of surprises have a huge impact, and I could feel that in the theatre as I joined several other Spider-Man fans cheer out for both heroes and villains. The action sequences were brilliant; seeing them in 3D is totally worth the price of admission. Every actor delivered a believable, realistic performance, and especially our lead actor Tom Holland. The visual effects too were top notch and the editing was stupendous. Two and a half hours flew by real quick while watching this popcorn action entertainer. It won't be fair to reveal anything, so here I conclude my review, and recommend you to check out this new world of Spidey-ness on the big screen and in 3D. And once you've seen it, please don't spoil it for others, just like you won't want it spoiled for yourself.</div>\n",

Solely for entertainment purposes, because Marvel Studios does make rather impressive movies, now don't they? Indeed. And that is also why I opted to sit down and watch the 2021 movie \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" here in 2022.<br/><br/>Actually, my family went to watch \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" back in 2021 when it was out in the cinema, but I didn't go, as I don't think superhero movies are worth the ticket admission for a cinema. So instead, I opted to watch it when it became readily accessible at the comforts of my home.<br/><br/>Writers Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers actually put together a wholesome enough storyline here for this movie, and sure it was watchable and enjoyable. Outstanding or memorable? No, not so much. But then again, I am not overly keen on the whole superhero genre. But \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" did provide me with entertainment for the 148 minutes that the movie ran for.<br/><br/>And it was actually fun enough to watch the various Spider-Men come together on the screen and fight the villains from previous movies all over again. Nostalgia? Perhaps. But at the same time, sort of lazy writing when you think about it.<br/><br/>Visually then \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" was phenomenal. But then again, that is what Marvel Studios excel at, isn't it?<br/><br/>\"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" certainly has a impressive cast list, with a lot of big names. I mean, you have Tom Holland, Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire as the Spider-Man, and then you have Jamie Foxx, Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina, Rhys Ifans and Thomas Haden Church return to reprise their former villainous roles. And the movie also have the likes of talents such as J. K. Simmons, Marisa Tomei, Jon Favreau and such on the cast list as well.<br/><br/>It was nice, though, to see that the writers were taking the many previous movies in the franchise with a grain of salt some times throughout the course of the movie, with the puns and snazzy dialogue hinting at and referencing previous movies.<br/><br/>\"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" definitely is a pleasing movie for the fans of superhero movies and of \"Spider-Man\" in general.<br/><br/>My rating of \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" lands on a six out of ten stars.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">I was already concerned about Spider-Man: No Way Home when I walked into the theater (one could say I was expecting to be disappointed.) I kind of hate the idea of delving too deep into a multiverse, because I think it muddles things too much, and defies the internal logic of most stories. Sure enough that was something I felt while watching this film. This movie cannot hold up to even the tiniest bit of analysis, because it creates plot holes that you can drive a freight train through. It's kind of sad because there were some moments in the movie that I genuinely loved, but all I can think about days later are the myriad of questions that I'm left with because this movie created so many situations that make no sense.<br/><br/>My other big problem with Spider-Man: No Way Home is not really a fault of the movie, but more of the society we live in today. Living in an internet-focused culture, we are bombarded by ads and news stories that relate to the things that interest us. SInce I've shown my love for all things MCU in the past, of course I see plenty of things crossing my radar about the upcoming films. I was able to avoid watching any trailers for this movie, which I thought would help, but by merely catching headlines of casting rumors I could foresee every surprise they built into it. Of course any logical mind could put two and two together once the guest appearances start, so I suppose this isn't a movie that is going to blow away audiences with its surprises.<br/><br/>As I said, though, my disappointment is quite frustrating because I also found many aspects of No Way Home so satisfying. They wrapped up some story elements nicely, and this might have contained some of the best acting in any Marvel movie. In particular, I found Zendaya so surprisingly strong, I was almost able to ignore her lack of character motivation in some key moments. She wasn't the only person in the film that behaved stupidly, in fact the central premise of the film is built on a horrible idea from Aunt May that seems altruistic, but lacks any 4th-dimensional thinking which I would expect from a genius like Peter Parker. But smart people being dumb is the catalyst of the entire story, as even Dr. Strange doesn't seem to think anything through, past Peter's initial request.<br/><br/>No Way Home is easily the most meta Spider-Man movie ever made, which is kind of shocking to say in a post \"Into the Spider-verse\" world. It's catering to the most die-hard fans in the world, but it's more of a nod to the fans of the Spider-Man movies. I was always a huge fan of the multitude of Spider-Man comic books when I was a collector, but I've typically struggled with his portrayal in films. So, giving all these nods to things that came before Tom Holland took over the role on the big screen, falls a bit flat for me. One of the things I loved about this iteration of the character is that it avoided the cliches and saved us so much of the traditional Spider-Man origin story, but this movie back-pedaled and became a copy of a copy of a copy.<br/><br/>This return to cliche also sucked some of the emotion out of key moments as any fan of the character should know the same old tropes by now. I almost got emotional at the end because of the great acting performances, but the big emotional moment earlier in the film did nothing for me as all I could think was \"really, we're going there?\" There are some good laughs in the film, although I wonder how well it will hold up on rewatch. And I will rewatch this film, as I do with all MCU movies, but I think at this point Spider-Man: No Way Home sits as my least favorite in the franchise. In fact, I'm at a point right now where I'm questioning if I will keep being a diehard fan of everything the MCU churns out. This film wasn't what I'd call a complete failure, but I'm concerned the MCU is getting closer to one of those. Perhaps EndGame should have been exactly what the title implies.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">It most likely Sony has to continue to soft re-boot this exhausting tedious story in order for them to maintain rights. In this case, it throws the entire kitchen sink including nods to the multiverse.<br/><br/>In this one Peter Parker rues the day people discover he is Spiderman. And in order to allow his friends to live a normal life he goes to Dr. Strange to conjure up a spell so he would be forgotten. Seriously. The entire movie is predicated on a stupid wish. Well obviously that goes wrong and a dimension portal opens to different worlds where villains dont recognize the present casted Peter Parker. Seems clever on paper but it is a slog. The only gimmick is that we see Peter Parkers from previous flicks. What you get are momentum killing conversations between the Spideys. Which, for fans, suppose it's great to shoehorn legacy. For people who are too young to know anyone of the previous ones. Im sure theyll be confused.<br/><br/>This entire movie moves at a snails pace and suffers from bloat. You can slash a half hour and still be fine. This culminates in the death of Aunt May. Because, if you follow the storylines Spidermans have to have a loved one die at their own stupid decisions. When will that end?<br/><br/>I suspected this would be the typical messy CGI garbage. And it didnt disappoint. It is greenscreen heaven.<br/><br/>There is a better story here. This one felt unnecessary.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">It took me a while to get around to watching No Way Home. There was so much hype, and people were declaring 'the hype is real.'<br/><br/>I feel alone on an island thinking this movie is terrible. I get that people were psyched about all the old Spider-Man characters coming together for a big super fun time, but that does not cover up for how nonsensical everything is in this film. (Spoilers incoming)<br/><br/>First the good. This will be a short segment. The idea to bring all the characters from the previous Spider-Man movies together through the multiverse is an awesome concept. The execution however was lazily conceived.<br/><br/>The two constant problems in the movie are the cringey dialogue and the incomprehensible decision making. The movie starts with Peter Parker's identity being revealed. Now if your identity is revealed where is the last place you want to go? The answer is your house. It appears no one told the writers this because that is where Parker goes. Also, Parker ask's Strange to put a spell on the world so his friends can go to MIT? How is that his rationale? Yes it gives purpose for the rest of the film but it's a lazy story telling way to get there. Why would Dr. Strange agree at all to that. He is a freaking wizard.<br/><br/>There is not a single line of dialogue that is intelligent. It's all cliches, lines that have been in previous movies, or just pop culture language with no substance. Towards the end I was cringing at the back and forth between characters, especially when Goblin says \"I'm something of a scientist myself.\" Yes we know that when you said it 20 years ago. (I loathe fan service.) There were a couple jokes that landed but overall I was laughing at parts that weren't supposed to be funny, like when all the Peter Parkers were in the lab with their goggles and test-tubes finding cures for the villains in less than 5 minutes. Again, lazy writing.<br/><br/>This is a movie for children who have no concept of reality or care about a well thought out story. (End rant.)</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">There is so much to unpack here. And I understand that some people may not be into the first 30 minutes or so of the movie, but it is apparent how much almost everyone loves this movie. And as you can tell I am one of them. Now you could dismiss my opinion, since I have clearly bought and swallowed the MCU pill (I openly admit liking and being a fan boy of what has been created there - you can hate me or simply agree with me, all opinions are welcome) ... but I dare anyone who has seen all Spider Man movies, not to feel at least something rather positive about this.<br/><br/>It does take many good things from previous efforts (no pun intended) and gets the best out of them. It does a great service to the (movie) history of Spider-Man. But also showing us a different side of a Marvel hero ... a side that is vulnerable in a way we have not seen yet. Or not in that form - the identity crisis and the good deeds that do not go unpunished ... or do they? Tom Holland has been exposed - something you know if you've seen the previous Spider-Man movie ... and while his mentor Iron Man dealt differently with that fame - recognition, Peter Parker as we know him, can not deal with it the same way.<br/><br/>Add to that, that he wants to help people as much as he can (a bit of a difference to what Tony Stark stood for most of the time, being self centered and and self serving) - and you have a dangerous combination. There is a reason the Tom Holland Spider-Man movies are being compared with 80s teen comedies - there are many parallels (John Hughes and others are being name dropped in those conversations). And while there is a lot of action (the mirror world scene has so many \"climactic\" scenes I probably did not close my mouth the entire time it was happening), the movie also takes its time to give us little character moments.<br/><br/>And a lot of fan service - this movie celebrates what came before. It celebrates and takes its audience seriously. But in a fun and entertaining way. Yes it is not all fun and games and there are a lot of callbacks (no pun intended) - there is drama, there may be even some head shaking at how naive Peter Parker seems ... but it makes sense in the realm of the world that was built around him and the character that he is - there is an evolution, but he can't help himself - being who he is and who he grew up to be. For better or worse ... yes the famous line will be uttered and it will have a sad undertone to it. But the movie is able to give you so much, that even when you know something completely horrible is about to happen, you also know that some lighter moments will follow.<br/><br/>That being said, it takes nothing away from the performance by Tom Holland, who has to play vulnerable, playful, ecstatic, experimental, shy and giving/helpful ... while a lot has been made of who is going to be in the movie (or not) - it is his movie. Yes there are many things that you can tear apart and make fun of - there are logic issues if you want to call them that ... but in a world where \"magic\" exists ... are you really going to nitpick? Maybe you will, which would be a shame - because you'll be missing out on one hell of a movie and a ride that is truly amazing - no pun intended.<br/><br/>It is also amazing that Sony and Disney reached a deal - so that Marvel can continue to use Spiderman in their universe. But not just him ... it seems there is way more to come. And while having many throwbacks (and callbacks) and bringing them all to a conclusion of sorts ... well while all that could mean that this could be a nice way to end Tom Hollands reign as Spider-Man ... it could just as easily continue. The possibilities are endless going forward.<br/><br/>As you can tell I am not one to spoil or say anything that is revealing. That is why I did not talk about the cast and the cameos - most of them were revealed ahead of time. Either officially (villains) or just through rumors (no matter how much denying went on - we knew ... we just knew) ... but there was a cameo that most did not see coming - pun very much intended.<br/><br/>If you watched this in a cinema (which I can only highly recommend to do), you will probably still have goosebumps. You either cheered yourself loudly at quite a few moments (or gasped at others) ... or just enjoyed silently ... what a movie experience that was. One that I might repeat in cinemas - a treat I do not give myself too often, because I tend to let a bit of time pass before I rewatch something after the first time viewing ... but there are exceptions and this might very well be one of them ... Spider-Man you Sir ... are one of the good ones! Pun again intended - because you too are amazing ...</div>\n",

Spider-Man: No Way Home is an impressive culmination of the films that came before it, with an engaging storyline, exciting action, laugh out loud moments, and dramatic consequences. The beginning climb is a little slow, but it's an exhilarating ride once things get swinging. I don't exactly know how this movie will hold up after multiple viewings, as there are some plot points that don't quite make sense when you start to think about them, but I thoroughly enjoyed myself this first time.</div>\n",

This was such an experience i honestly felt like a kid again. I can't believe they returned! I was so happy to see my childhood come to life.<br/><br/>This was a incrediblely told story about The 3 peters and how deep responsibility truly is, I'm shocked with excitement in we had the great men themselves return to their respective roles which included Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina, Jamie Foxx, Thomas Haden church and many more. I've always been a massive fan of Tobey &amp; Andrew so seeing them come back was the ultimate time of my life. I loved every second of it, i wanted to review this with no spoilers but that is literally impossible ao i now have +1 Spoiler review.<br/><br/>There were so many nods and callbacks to the past which i thoight went very well &amp; Garfield finally avenged not saving gwen!<br/><br/>Highly Recommend! A Must See!!! 11/10.</div>\n",

I absolutely love the grand scale of everything from the multiverse, characters, massive budget, tingling sense is so well done, and the humor is spot on.

Because he's so good inside? There are infinite villains and Spider-Man so this motivation is weak and frustratingly illogical.<br/><br/>Plus they stuff up a magic spell and no one thinks to go find Wanda? Theyve clearly outlined she's more powerful than the sorceress supreme. No? No one?<br/><br/>Not go to Wakanda? Nothing?<br/><br/>Killing May is just the same 'fridging that all the lame old superhero movies use to isolate the hero. It's dull as dishwater and now they've wiped away all the coolness of this interaction for out of date adages.<br/><br/>And the moping... Jesus Christ that's dull. All the navel gazing 'what's it all about', 'who am I'. Massive yawn. This movie was at least 20 mins too long.<br/><br/>The big reveal of Toby and Andrew? What a letdown. Wouid have been better in an action scene where Spider-Man is about to smashed and a web comes out of nowhere... much cooler.<br/><br/>And lastly the memory wipe. So no one remembers him? What about school records? How does Happy know he knows May 'through Spider-Man'? Who does he think that is then?<br/><br/>This movie is a 7 and anyone giving it any more is just excited because of the fan theory hype and not.</div>\n",

Shang-Chi was only ok, the Venom sequel was atrocious, Black Widow was so-so, Eternals was bland for the most part. What makes this one work is the cast, but the story really, when examined is weak. The last movie put the writers in a corner while revealing (a silly idea really) Peter's identity to the world. He goes to Doctor Strange without thinking about what he really wants, and ends up, in typical spider-man fashion, in screwing everything up. So, also in usual Spider-Man style, by trying to fix things up, he totally messes up further. In the end this costs him a lot. While this movie starts out well, the middle is dull and why should Peter care about beings from alternate realities? And by 'fixing' them, did he erase the events of those films, making the spider-men of those realities unnecessary? Peter loses everything due to his listening to Aunt May, who's advice is illogical and gets her killed. Well, I can say this was the best of Holland's trilogy, but it still isn't Spider-Man 2. A few sides: Molina, Garfield and Maguire's returns were the best part of this movie. Those three steal every single scene they're in. Dafoe was good as Norman, but I could have done without Electro and Sandman who added little to the story. While others are falling over themselves gushing over this, I think I may be suffering from Superhero fatigue.</div>\n",
